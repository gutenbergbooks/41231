<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="l25" />

<p>In preparing for the press "<span class="smcap">The Life and Beauties
of Fanny Fern</span>," we have given to the reader a statement
of the most prominent incidents in her eventful
career, which is authenticated, not only by the testimony
of her nearest relatives, but by communications
from her own lips. The lives of distinguished men
or women have always been accounted public property,
and, in narrating that of Fanny Fern, we have confined
ourselves to simple facts, leaving the fancy-pictures to
be filled up by others.</p>

<p>In giving selections from her "Beauties," we present
the reader with a bouquet of "Ferns," all freshly
gathered. In so doing, we have infringed on no one's
copy-right; the sketches having been copied, in every
instance, from the papers to which they were originally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IV" id="Page_IV">iv</a></span>
contributed. A large proportion of them have never
before appeared within the covers of a book. These
latter are the very articles upon which Fanny made her
reputation. We have given quotations which do justice
to every variety of her versatile style. One page
flashes with the keen edge of satire, another brims over
with mirth, and a third is tearful with pathos.</p>

<p>We have shown Fanny at home, on the street, and
in church, and have thus furnished a key which will
unlock many of the mysteries of "Ruth Hall," and
"Fern Leaves."</p>

GENIUS IN PANTALETTES.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
Saral Payson Willis, the subject of this
sketch, was born in Portland, Maine, July 9th,
1811. Through the negligence, doubtless, of the
clerk of the town, it is not recorded that the sun
stood still on the eventful morning, but old housewives
tell a legend of the cocks' crowing with
extraordinary shrillness in honor of this wonderful
advent. She is the daughter of Mr. Nathaniel
Willis, one of the most industrious and respectable
citizens of Boston, now a man well advanced
in years. It is scarcely necessary to add that she
is sister to Mr. N. P. Willis, the brilliant essayist
and poet.</p>

<p>Mr. Willis, senior, "commenced life" as a mechanic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
and at the time of his marriage worked
at the case as a journeyman printer. He afterwards
published the Eastern Argus, in Portland.
Meeting with reverses in that city, he removed
to Boston, where he established, and for many
years edited, the "Recorder," the oldest religious
paper in New-England.</p>

<p>Mr. Willis has met with a similar experience to
that of most men in his calling. He never made
a fortune at publishing. At the present time,
although aged and infirm, he finds it necessary
to devote his failing energies to the publication
of the "Youth's Companion." Yet, notwithstanding
his narrow means, Mr. Willis contrived&mdash;at
how great a sacrifice only parents can guess,
to give his sons and daughters that education
which is a poor man's noblest legacy.</p>

FANNY AT SCHOOL.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
In accordance with the course he had wisely
planned for his children, Sarah Willis&mdash;the
veritable "Fanny"&mdash;was favored with an early introduction
into the seminary of Miss Catherine E.
Beecher, in Hartford, Conn. At this well-conducted
establishment&mdash;the most popular in the
country, at that time&mdash;Miss Fanny received her
first strong impressions of life and the world. We
have never heard her spoken of as a very apt or
studious pupil. Staid works of philosophy and
learning were not much to her taste. But from
the prohibited pages of romances and poems, eagerly
devoured in secret, her craving genius derived an
active stimulus. Already she had become a keen
dissector of the human heart, and she found plenty
of pleasant practice for the scalpel of her wit among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
the young ladies of the school. Here, too, the
novel and startling experiences of boarding-school
flirtation gave their warm coloring to her future
life. Fanny possessed a large capacity for this
description of knowledge, and her writings show a
better memory for those more pleasant branches
of female education, than for the dry rules of syntax
and prosody. In fact, the best of her sketches
are transcripts of her school-girl life&mdash;for Fanny
writes well only when giving the concentrated vinegar
and spice of her own vivid experiences.</p>

<p>A sketch of Fanny's, entitled "<span class="smcap">A Leaf from
my Experience</span>," referring to her school-life,
may, perhaps, form the best embodiment of the
earlier portion of her school-history.</p>

<p class="p2">
"Miss Jemima Keturah Rix was at the head of
a flourishing school for very young ladies and gentlemen.
She originated in the blue state of Connecticut,
where the hens, from principle, refrain
from laying eggs on Sunday, and the yeast stops
<i>working</i> for the same reason. She had very little
opinion of her own sex, and none at all of the other.
Her means were uncommonly limited, yet 'she
was too much of a gentlewoman to keep school,
had it not been for her strong desire to reform the
rising generation.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>"In person, she was tall and spare, with small,
snapping black eyes, and thin, compressed lips,
telling strongly of her vixenish propensities. She
could repeat the Ten Commandments and Assembly's
Catechism <i>backwards</i>, without missing a word;
and was a firm believer in total depravity and the
eternal destruction of little dead babies.</p>

<p>"She had the usual variety of temper and disposition,
generally found in a school, and a way of
her own of getting along with them. She would
catch a refractory pupil with one hand by the
shoulder, and press the thumb with such force into
the hollow of the arm, that the poor victim was
ready to subscribe to any articles of faith or practice
she might see fit to draw up; and who of us
will soon forget that old brass thimble, mounted on
her skinny forefinger, as it came snapping against
our foreheads?</p>

<p>"Being considered an untamable witch at home,
I had the ill luck to be sent to this little initiatory
purgatory. This was unfortunate, as Miss Rix and
I looked at life through very different pairs of
spectacles. The first great grief I can remember,
was when I was about as tall as a rosebush,&mdash;nearly
breaking my heart, because a little boy <i>threw away</i>
one of my ringlets, that I cut off for his especial
keeping. In fact, I may as well own it, I was <i>born</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
a <i>coquette</i>; and the lynx eyes of Miss Rix had
already discovered it.</p>

<p>"She always made a chalk line on the floor between
the girls and boys, that neither were allowed
to cross without a special permit. Being aware of
this, I had been in the habit of making certain
telegraphic communications with a little lover of
mine, in jacket and trowsers, on the other side of
chalk-dom.</p>

<p>"Little dreaming of the storm that was brewing,
I sat watching her one morning, as she slowly drew
from her pocket a long piece of cord, and tested its
strength. Raising her sharp cracked voice to its
most crucifying pitch, she called,</p>

<p>"'Miss Minnie May and Mr. Harry Hall step
out upon the floor.' Of course, we didn't do anything
else, when, turning us back to back, she
silently proceeded to tie our elbows together with
the cord, remarking, with a satanic grin, as she sat
down, that 'we seemed to be so fond of each other,
it was a pity to keep us apart.'</p>

<p>"Now this was a very <i>cutting</i> thing to me, in
more ways than one, as Harry's jacket sleeves protected
<i>his</i> arms, while my little fat elbows were
getting redder every minute from the twitches he
made to extricate himself; for, like some bigger
boys, he was very willing to be a <i>fair-weather</i> lover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
but couldn't face a <i>storm</i>. I've never forgiven him
for it, (true to my woman nature,) and though I
often meet him now, (he is a thriving physician
with an extensive practice;) and he looks so
roguishly from out those saucy black eyes, as much
as to say, 'I wouldn't mind being <i>tied</i> to you now,
Minnie,' I give him a perfect freezer of a look and
'pass by on the other side.'</p>

<p>"I understand that Miss Rix has rested from her
labors and gone to her reward. I wish no better
satisfaction than that she <i>may get it</i>!"
</p>

THE NEW NAME.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Fanny's career as a young lady seems to have
been very lively. She recalls many amusing
reminiscences of early flirtations. Among others,
she led away captive the heart of a certain Unitarian
clergyman, the son of a wealthy family. As
<i>she</i> affirms, however, "papa" concluded that he
had learned the Westminster Catechism to so little
purpose as to be no safe partner for his orthodox
daughter. But, like a large spare chamber, swept
and garnished, her affections had plenty of room
for a new occupant.</p>

<p>There were breezy walks on the common, mysterious
whisperings over skeins of thread with
handsome clerks, until at length the conquering
hero came. Like a sun-flower in the beams of
morning, her heart expanded at the warm suit of
her favored lover.</p>

<p>May 4th, 1837, at a period of well-matured
womanhood, Sarah Willis became Sarah Eldredge.
The fortunate husband of the yet undeveloped
genius, was an only child&mdash;the son of the late Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Eldredge, a highly esteemed physician, in the
neighborhood of Boston. Her first child died at
the age of three years, but two remaining daughters,
the fruit of this union, now reside with their
mother in New York. One is about ten, and the
other we should judge from her appearance to
be some fifteen years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. Eldredge enjoyed a handsome income from
his services as cashier of the Merchant's Bank, the
largest institution of the kind in Boston. Now
we esteem the domestic virtues of economy and
prudence; but a penurious mode of life is not so
readily pardoned as the opposite extreme of lavish
expenditure; and the devoted husband of so
spirited a young wife may certainly be excused for
"living" to the extent of his means. But, as
Othello very properly observes, "Who can control
his fate?" Had the young banker been as wise
as he was generous and indulgent, he would have
looked forward through the long, bright vista of
the present, to that proverbial "rainy day," liable
at any time to befall. In the prime of manhood,
October 6th, 1846, he was cut off by a sharp,
quick stroke from Death's remorseless hand; and
the wife and mother, awaking suddenly from her
gay dreams, saw affliction and widowhood descend
upon her like a pall.</p>

THE HUSBAND'S DEATH.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Throughout the whole course of Fanny's
writings we are presented with frequent and
most pleasing pictures of her own self. Not only
does she figure as the graceful heroine of "Ruth
Hall," but all her sketches have a connection
more or less remote with the events of her own
life. The following sketch, as we are assured, is
a description of the death of her husband, though
it contains one of the customary portraitures of
Fanny herself.</p>

<p class="p2">
"<span class="smcap">The Young Wife's Affliction</span>.&mdash;A delightful
summer we passed, to be sure, at the &mdash;&mdash;
Hotel, in the quiet village of S&mdash;&mdash;. A collection
of prettier women, or more gentlemanly, agreeable
men, were never thrown together by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
necessity of seeking country quarters in the dog-days.
Fashion, by common consent, was laid
upon the shelf, and comfort and smiling faces
were the natural result. Husbands took the cars
in the morning for the city, rejoicing in linen
coats and pants, and loose neck-ties; their wives,
equally independent till their return, in flowing
muslin wrappers, not too dainty for the wear and
tear of little climbing feet, fresh from the meadow
or wildwood.</p>

<p>"There were no separate 'cliques' or 'sets;'
nobody knew, or inquired, or cared, whether your
great grandfather had his horse shod, or shoed
horses for other people. The ladies were not
afraid of smutting their fingers, or their reputation,
if they washed their own children's faces;
and didn't consider it necessary to fasten the door,
and close the blinds, when they replaced a missing
button on their husband's waistband, or mended a
ragged frock.</p>

<p>"Plenty of fruit, plenty of fresh, sweet air,
plenty of children, and plenty of room for them
to play in. A short nap in the afternoon, a little
additional care in arranging tumbled ringlets, and
in girding a fresh robe round the waist, and they
were all seated in the cool of the evening on the
long piazza, smiling, happy, and expectant, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
car bell announced the return of their liege lords
from the dusty, heated city. It was delightful to
see their <i>business faces</i> brighten up, as each fair
wife came forward and relieved them from the
little parcels and newspapers they carried in their
hands, and smiled a welcome, sweet as the cool,
fresh air that fanned their heated foreheads. A
cold bath, a clean dickey, and they were presentable
at the supper table, where merry jokes flew
round, and city news was discussed between the
fragrant cups of tea, and each man fell in love
with his pretty wife <i>over again</i>, (or his <i>neighbor's</i>,
if he liked!)</p>

<p>"It was one harmonious, happy family! Mrs.
&mdash;&mdash; and her husband were the prime ministers
of fun and frolic in the establishment. It was
<i>she</i> who concocted all the games, and charades,
and riddles, that sent our merry shouts ringing
far and wide, as we sat in the evening on the long
moonlit piazza. It was she who planned the picnics
and sails, and drives in the old hay-cart; the
berry parties, and romps on the green; and the
little cosy suppers in the back parlor just before
bed time (that nobody but herself could have
coaxed out of the fussy old landlord.) It was she
who <i>salted</i> our coffee and <i>sugared</i> our toast; it was
she who made puns for us, and wrote verses; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
was she who sewed up pockets in overcoats, or
stole cigars, or dipped the ends in water; it was
she who nursed all the sick children in the house;
it was she who cut out frocks, and pinafores, and
caps, for unskilful mothers; it was she who was
here and there, and every where, the embodiment
of mischief, and fun, and kindness; and as
she flew past her handsome husband, (with her
finger on her lip,) bent upon some new prank, he
would look after her with a proud, happy smile,
<i>more eloquent than words</i>.</p>

<p>"He was the handsomest man I ever saw&mdash;tall,
commanding and elegant, with dark blue eyes, a
profusion of curling black hair, glittering white
teeth, and a form like Apollo's. Mary was <i>so
proud</i> of him! She would always watch his eye
when she meditated any little piece of roguery, and
it was discontinued or perfected <i>as she read its language</i>.
He was just the man to appreciate her&mdash;to
understand her sensitive, enthusiastic nature;
to know when to check, when to encourage; and
it needed but <i>a word, a look</i>; for her <i>whole soul</i>
went out to him.</p>

<p>"And so the bright summer days sped fleetly
on; and now autumn had come, with its gorgeous
beauty, and no one had courage to speak of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
breaking up our happy circle; but ah! there came
<i>one</i>, with stealthy steps, <i>who had no such scruples</i>!</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>"The merry shout of the children is hushed in
the wide halls; anxious faces are grouped on the
piazza; for in a darkened room above, lies Mary's
princely husband, delirious with fever! The smile
has fled her lip, the rose her cheek; her eye is
humid with tears <i>that never fall</i>; day and night
without sleep or food, she keeps untiring vigil;
while (unconscious of her presence,) in tones that
pierce her heart, he calls unceasingly for 'my
wife!' She puts back the tangled masses of dark
hair from his heated forehead; she passes her little
hand coaxingly over it; she hears not the advice
of the physician, 'to procure a nurse.' She fears
not to be alone with him when he is raving. She
tells no one that on her delicate breast she bears
the impress of an (almost) <i>deadly</i> blow from the
hand that was never before raised but to <i>bless her</i>.
And now the physician, who has come <i>once, twice,
thrice</i> a day from the city, tells the anxious groups
in the hall that his patient <i>must die</i>; not one dare
break the news to the wretched Mary! There is
little need! She has gazed in their faces with a
keen, agonized earnestness; she has asked no
questions, but she knows it all; and her heart is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
dying within her! No entreaty, no persuasion can
draw her from the bedside.</p>

<p>"The old doctor, with tearful eyes, passes his
arm round her trembling form, and says, 'My
child, you <i>cannot</i> meet the <i>next hour</i>&mdash;leave him
with me.'</p>

<p>"A mournful shake of the head is his only answer,
as she takes her seat again by her husband,
and presses her forehead low, upon that clammy
hand; praying God that <i>she</i> may die with him.</p>

<p>"An hour of <span class="smcap">TIME</span>&mdash;an <span class="smcap">ETERNITY</span> of agony has
passed! A fainting, unresisting form is borne
from that chamber of <i>Death</i>.</p>

<p>"Beautiful as a piece of rare sculpture, lies the
husband!&mdash;no trace of pain on lip or brow; the
long, heavy lashes lie upon the marble cheek; the
raven locks, damp with the dew of death, cluster
profusely round the noble forehead; those chiseled
lips are gloriously beautiful in their repose!
Tears fall like rain from kindly eyes; servants
pass to and fro, respectfully, with measured tread;
kind hands are busy with vain attempts to restore
animation to the fainting wife. Oh that <i>bitter</i>,
<span class="smcap">BITTER</span> waking! (for she <i>does</i> wake. God pity
her!)</p>

<p>"Her hand is passed slowly across her forehead;
she remembers! she is a widow!! She looks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
about the room&mdash;there is his hat, his coat, his cane;
and <i>now</i>, indeed, she throws herself, with a burst
of passionate grief, into the arms of the old physician,
who says, betwixt a tear and a smile, 'Now
God be praised&mdash;<span class="smcap">SHE WEEPS</span>!'</p>

<p>"And so with the falling leaves of Autumn,
'the Great Reaper' gathered in our noble friend.
Why should I dwell on the agony of the gentle
wife? or tell of her return to her desolate home in
the city; of the disposal of the rare pictures and
statuary collected to grace its walls by the refined
taste of its proprietor; of the <span class="smcap">NECESSARY</span> disposal
of every <i>article of luxury</i>; of her removal to plain
lodgings, where curious people speculated upon
her history, and marked her moistened eyes; of the
long, interminable, wretched days; of the wakeful
nights, when she lay with her cheek pressed
against the sweet, fatherless child of her love; of
her untiring efforts to seek an honorable, independent
support? It is but an every-day history, but
(God knows) its crushing weight of agony is none
the less keenly felt by the sufferer!"
</p>

THE SECOND MARRIAGE.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Fortunately for the subject of our sketch,
her father, though poor, as we have said,
hastened to make what provision he could afford
for the comfort of the broken family. Nor did
Dr. Eldredge turn a deaf ear, or pass by on the
other side. Some bitter thoughts were doubtless
occasioned, by the remembrance of the luxuries
of which she had been so suddenly bereft; it
was hard to sink like a star behind the hills of
adversity&mdash;to pass suddenly from a gay and
splendid career into the obscurity of a more
common-place and quiet life; and we can excuse
the sensitive Fanny for some unreasonable complaints;
but, thanks to her own and her husband's
father, she had the consolation and treasure of a
home&mdash;a <i>home</i>, which, however modest, was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
every respect comfortable, and not altogether
inelegant.</p>

<p>Sarah Eldredge was now in the full flush and
vigor of womanhood&mdash;and a widow! It is a wise
provision of nature which ordains that the most
deeply wounded heart shall not always bleed.
Hope springs from the ashes of grief. Time
buries the dead past, and lifts the curtain from
the glowing future. Night comes, that another
morning, with all its glory and freshness, may
dawn upon the earth. Why then waste the
energies of youth in mourning over graves?
They will not give up their dead; already the
spirit of the lost one looks down upon us from
blissful spheres, and says, "Be happy!" to our
sorrowing hearts. Such a voice came to the
young widow. She called reason and faith to
her aid. She saw herself still blooming and
attractive; the same inviting world lay all around
her; she longed for sympathy, for change, for
life. Her first matrimonial venture had proved
a happy one; and the memory thereof prompted
her to risk another voyage on Wedlock's perilous
sea. Thus it might have been the very power
of love that bound her to her first husband which
threw open the welcoming doors to the advances
of a new suitor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Farrington, a merchant of Boston&mdash;a man
of energy and upright character&mdash;made an offer
of his hand. He had himself enjoyed matrimonial
experience&mdash;was himself a parent&mdash;and was well
qualified to sympathize with the young widow.
They sought mutual consolation in marriage.
But scarce was the honeymoon over, when that
mutual consolation was followed by mutual surprise.
Fanny learned to her sorrow that all
husbands are not equally fond and indulgent;
and the bridegroom discovered that Mrs. F. No. 2
wasn't the exact counterpart of Mrs. F. No. 1.
The contrast was, in fact, so vast and amazing,
that it seemed to require solitude and quiet, to
consider it in all its bearings. Accordingly, Mr.
Farrington resorted to travel and a change of
scene; journeyed westward; and has not since
been seen on the down-east slope of the continent.
The slender tie of affection between the happy
pair, thus long drawn out, like a thread of India
rubber, finally snapped.</p>

<p>At the time of his departure, Fanny was boarding
with her children at the Marlboro' Hotel in
Boston. Soon after, however, she removed to
quiet but pleasant lodgings in another quarter of
the city.</p>

<p>Mr. Farrington took up his abode in Chicago,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
and soon after Fanny was connubially advertised
in the columns of the Boston Daily Bee. Then,
from the auction mart of a western court, Mr. F.
gave out three warnings; cried&mdash;"Going!&mdash;going!!&mdash;gone!!!"
and legally knocked down his
wife with the hammer of divorce.</p>

<p>Once more separated from her husband, the
dashing Fanny wore no mourning weeds. Her
lively circle of acquaintances found her fireside no
less attractive than formerly. Once more a widow
she had learned to wear gracefully her honors.</p>

<h2>VI.<br /><a name="chap_VI" id="chap_VI"></a>

FANNY FERN AT HOME.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Fanny Fern's writings are expressive of her
character. But, if possible, she is twice as original,
spicy, and entertaining, in her person as in
her sketches. To understand her perfectly, one
should see her and talk with her; and to see her
and talk with her to advantage, one should meet her
on terms of chatty familiarity in her own private
apartments.</p>

<p>Fanny's home in Boston is well remembered by
her favored acquaintances. Introduced into her
unique parlor, the visitor found himself surrounded
by pleasing evidences of luxury and taste, characterizing
its occupant as a woman of elegant leisure.
A subdued, monastic light, pervading the apartment,
never failed to add its charm to the visit.
Convenient shutters, and heavy folds of curtains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
robbed the saucy daylight of its too garish beams,
and by night, in the still and quiet hours, a rich
shade surrounded the glowing globe of the astral,
tempering its lustre to a soft, mellow effulgence.</p>

<p>Fanny&mdash;as we have hinted&mdash;is just like her
sketches, only "more so." Bubbles and flashes
might be gathered from her conversation, that
would eclipse anything she ever wrote. To have
her sit by your side one hour, and&mdash;&mdash;sparkle,
(<i>talk</i> don't express the idea,) is worth all the Fern
Leaves and Ruth Halls in the world. Witty and
pathetic by turns; now running over with fun,
and now with tears; always sprightly, always
plain and terse in her language, she is sure to entertain
you for one hour at least, as no other
woman can. She will entertain you another hour,
some time, if you choose. But the probability is,
you don't choose. Such women don't wear well.
Their conversations are like "Fern Leaves"&mdash;brilliant
enough at first, but presently wearisome, and
insipid. Consequently they have a great many
short acquaintances, but no long ones. Their
friends are not fast friends. We doubt if Fanny
ever enjoyed an enthusiastic friendship which lasted
more than a couple of years.</p>

<p>Fanny's words are the least of her fascinations.
Her manner is that of a consummate actress. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
it is not long before you discover that she is little
else than an actress. Her tears are regular stage
tears. If she desires to excite your sympathy, she
knows better than anybody else, how to do it.
She'll improvise a "Ruth Hall" story for you, inventing
wrongs and sufferings to fit the occasion,
and drop a few ready tears, like hot wax, to seal
her testimony,&mdash;sometimes sobbing a little, and
pressing your hand convulsively, to heighten the
effect.</p>

<p>Oh, she can be fascinating as Cleopatra. She
knows how to thrill you with an unexpected
touch. Then her voice, how artistically tender its
modulations, how musically mirthful, how musically
sad by turns! Oh, Fanny is a great woman!
She should go upon the stage, or institute a new
"school of art and design" for the fair sex.</p>

<p>Fanny has an off-hand, dashing way of entertaining
company, which we have never seen surpassed.
If you are so fortunate as to be a favored
visitor, and to find her alone, you may make sure
of her, for at least one evening. No matter who
calls; the haughty Mr. A., the foppish B., the
jealous and frowning C., are all neglected for your
sake. "Sit still," says Fanny, "and they'll have
sense enough to see they are not wanted, and withdraw."
Accordingly, in a little while, out goes A.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
very stiffly. Then B. retires, bowing snobbishly,
and making insipid remarks about the weather.
Finally comes poor C.'s gruff and lowering "good
evening." And Fanny, clapping her hands, and
laughing merrily, rejoins you upon the sofa, after
shutting the door upon her last visitor&mdash;and whispering
a consoling word in his ear, behind your
back. Oh, matchless, diplomatic Fanny!</p>

<p>Of course the polite Fanny does the agreeable in
introducing you to her friends. But she entertains
odd ideas about names. Sometimes you are ready
to explode in convulsions of mirth, at the delightfully
careless manner in which she bestows upon
you some comic patronymic, never before heard of
in your family history. To-night you are Mr.
Pilridge. Last night you figured as Smith. To-morrow
you'll be Jenkins or Jones.</p>

<p>Fanny is consistent, and invents names for all
her visitors. You are no exception. Mr. White
is introduced to you as Mr. Brown. (Why,
indeed, shouldn't a lady take the same liberty
with her friends' names as with her own complexion,
and just change the color a trifle?) Mr.
Webb becomes Mr. Wing&mdash;a mere difference
of <i>a pinion</i>. Mr. Rose is transformed into Mr.
Minks,&mdash;probably on the principle that a rose by
any other name will smell as sweet. In the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
way a Walker is dignified as a Ryder; Dix is
expanded into Richards; Rich becomes Poore,
and French is translated into English.</p>

<p>Now mistakes will happen in the best regulated
families. Some funny ones occur in Fanny's.
'Tisn't so easy a thing to remember all her names.
Accordingly, forgetting that you are called Johnson,
for this evening, you gravely address Mr.
Howard by that name. That gentleman replies,
with a knowing smile, that Johnson is <i>your</i> name&mdash;you
laugh, Fanny laughs, and it passes as a
good joke. Or, perhaps, the other visitor has also
become slightly confused, and readily subscribing
to Johnson, bestows Howard upon you, by way
of exchange. Or, while passing for Smith, you
meet some one who knew you last week as
Pilridge.</p>

<p>Another pleasant incident is liable to occur.
By a coincidence, you meet at Fanny's some
friend whom you astonish into silence. You are
similarly astonished; and observing no signs of
recognition, Fanny proceeds to introduce you.
You can scarcely contain yourself on hearing
familiar Bob Peters dubbed as General Budington;
and he looks hugely tickled at your appellation
of Rev. Mr. Bird.</p>

<p>One additional circumstance we should not fail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
to state. You never meet a lady visitor at Fanny's.
There appears to be but little affinity between
her and her own sex. "Cause unknown,"
as coroners' verdicts say of "poor deaths" that
occur through neglect of the city authorities.</p>

EARLY LITERARY EFFORTS.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Fanny first appeared before the public, in the
columns of the <i>Olive Branch</i>, sometimes as
"<span class="smcap">Fanny Fern</span>," and in several instances as "<span class="smcap">Olivia
Branch</span>." We knew, personally, the good
old man, "frosty, yet kindly," who at that time
filled the editorial chair of that paper. We remember
distinctly his own account of some of
their frequent interviews. Like most others who
viewed Fanny through the enchanted medium of
a not too intimate acquaintance, he was, in some
sense, dazzled by her fascinations. Fanny is a
regular meteor. You cannot choose but look at
her, even if you don't place much faith in a light
so erratic and fitful. The bewildered old gentleman
felt the touch of those magnetic little fingers
upon his shoulder, and looked up, over his spectacles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
in absolute bewilderment, at the thing of
smiles and tears standing before him.</p>

<p>No wonder that he thought the sensitive, impulsive
Fanny must be faultless, and sympathized
profoundly in her execrations on hard-hearted
parents and tyrannical husbands. No wonder, if
defended by such lips, the worse appeared the
better reason&mdash;and the price per column dwindled
into comparative insignificance. Mr. Norris was
Fanny's faithful friend. Already tottering toward
the grave, he was not, indeed, able to render her
as much actual service as the younger and more
vigorous editor of <i>The True Flag</i>, who was, next
to Mr. N., her earliest patron, but the proprietor
of the Olive Branch gave her employment, friendship
and counsel, which should have secured in
return, at least gratitude.</p>

<p>As we have intimated, Fanny had contributed
but few articles to the Olive Branch, before forming
an engagement with the <i>Boston True Flag</i>, and
our next chapter will be devoted to a graphic
description of her connection with that paper, by
its editor.</p>

<h2>VIII.<br /><a name="chap_VIII" id="chap_VIII"></a>

FANNY AND THE TRUE FLAG.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Scene, <span class="smcap">True Flag Office, Morning</span>.&mdash;<i>Industrious
Editor at his desk.</i>&mdash;Enter dapper
young gentleman, bowing.&mdash;Editor, with a pen
over each ear and one in his fingers, looks up, nodding
politely.</p>

<p><i>Young Gent.</i>&mdash;Are you in want of contributions
to your paper?</p>

<p><i>Ed.</i>&mdash;We are always glad to get good original
articles, sir. Please take a seat.</p>

<p><i>Y. G.</i>&mdash;Thank you, sir. (Sits down in a Flag-bottomed
chair&mdash;we mean, a chair with a pile of
True Flags in it.) I am not a writer myself, but I
have a lady friend, who, although inexperienced,
manifests a good deal of literary talent, and would
like to try her hand at an article or two for your
paper. She belongs to a distinguished literary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
family; her father is an editor, and she has a
brother who is also an editor, and the author of
several of the most popular books ever published
in this country.</p>

<p><i>Ed.</i>&mdash;Very well; we should be pleased to see a
specimen of what she can do. (Y. G. withdraws.)</p>

<p>Such was substantially the manner in which the
yet unknown authoress, destined soon to become
so celebrated, was first introduced to our notice.
We should not, however, fail to state, in this connection,
that already Mr. Norris, of the Olive
Branch, had communicated to a member of our
firm the fact, that a sister of Mr. N. P. Willis had
applied to him for employment, and that he had
recommended the True Flag as an additional source
of income. Therefore, without the calling of
names, we were prepared to make a shrewd guess
at the identity of the young gent's lady friend.</p>

<p>According to agreement, a couple of fragrant
Ferns were plucked in due season, (no pun on the
word <i>due</i>,) and sent to our office. We found the
leaves a little coarse in fibre, but spicy, and acceptable.
Fanny wrote upon a big foolscap page, in a
large, open, very masculine hand. The manuscript
was characteristic&mdash;decidedly Ferny&mdash;dashed
all over with astonishing capitals and crazy
italics&mdash;and stuck full with staggering exclamation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
points, as a pin-cushion with pins. In print, the
italics were intended to resemble jolly words leaning
over and tumbling down with laughter, and
the interjections were supposed to be tottering under
the two-fold weight of double-entendres and
puns. At first sight, the writing looked as though
it might have been paced off by trained canary-birds&mdash;driven
first through puddles of ink, then
marched into hieroglyphic drill on the sheet like a
militia company on parade. All Fanny's manuscripts
demanded a good deal of editorial care to
prepare them for the press; her first productions,
particularly, requiring as thorough weeding as so
many beds of juvenile beets and carrots.</p>

<p>Fanny's price&mdash;we mean the price of her articles&mdash;was
two dollars a column. This was readily
acceded to; and the young gent received the money
for her first contributions&mdash;eight dollars for
four columns&mdash;the morning after their delivery
into our hands. In this place, it would be inexcusable
not to speak of another characteristic of
the Fern manuscripts. When purchased, paid for,
properly pruned and prepared for the printer's
hands, they were invariably found to fall short of
the stipulated amount of reading matter&mdash;one of
her spread-eagle pages nestling very quietly and
nicely into a few lines of print. So trifling a circumstance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
however, was not, of course, to be considered,
in dealing with a lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another Scene. True Flag Office, ten
o'clock, A. M.</span> <i>Editor at his desk, with pens as before,
and an additional pencil in his hair</i>.&mdash;Enter
jaunty bonnet, with gay feathers, elegant veil, rich
broadcloth cloak, and silk dress&mdash;rather magnificent,
if not more so. Editor hastens to place a
chair.</p>

<p><i>Jaunty Bonnet</i>, (in a low, half-whisper, under the
veil)&mdash;Excuse me&mdash;I'm a little out of breath, running
up stairs. I've brought Mr. Snooks to introduce
me.</p>

<p>Mr. Snooks turned out to be a Fern manuscript.
The jaunty bonnet carried him in an elegant
reticule, in close proximity to a coquettish
hankerchief, redolent of perfume. The jaunty
bonnet turned out to be&mdash;Fanny herself! Mr.
Snooks was for sale, and we bought him. Price,
two dollars a column&mdash;cheap enough for Snooks.
We afterwards dotted his <i>i's</i>, dressed him up a
little, changed his name&mdash;Snooks was a bad name&mdash;and
printed him.</p>

<p>This was our first interview with the witty and
brilliant Fanny. Certainly, we did not judge that
so gay and fashionable an attire had that morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
issued from a dismal garret, in a dark and narrow
lane&mdash;that those well-rounded proportions drew
their sole subsistence from the "hom&oelig;opathic
broth" of niggardly landladies. Indeed, no starving
necessity had compelled her to resort to the pen.
With a true woman's spirit, she believed she could
do something for herself, and determined to try.
We liked her articles&mdash;she liked our pay&mdash;so we
engaged her as a regular contributor. We suggested
that she should write stories, in addition to
her sketches&mdash;by which arrangement she might
easily earn fifteen dollars a week. She pleaded the
necessity of finishing everything she undertook, at
one sitting, and her inability to elaborate a long
story. Still she desired more employment; at the
same time, the too-frequent repetition of "Fanny
Fern" in our columns would injure both herself
and us; so the matter was compromised by giving
her a second <i>nom de plume</i>&mdash;that of "Olivia,"&mdash;which
was attached to a number of her sketches.</p>

<p>Up to this period, Mrs. Farrington had no reputation
whatever as a writer, and we purchased her
articles for their intrinsic merits only, paying for
them what they were actually worth to us. As
her reputation increased, and her value as a contributor
was heightened, her remuneration was augmented
accordingly. Although we paid her five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
dollars a column,&mdash;the columns generally falling
short one-third, at that,&mdash;we cheerfully gave her
her own terms, until, when she demanded twelve
dollars a column, we thought we would just take
three or four days to scratch our editorial ear, and
think about it. In this place, it may be proper to
state that, at one time, without giving us any notice
whatever, she broke her engagement, and entered
into a contract with a New York publisher,
by which she was to write exclusively for his paper
for one year. The terms offered were liberal, and
for her sake, we rejoiced at her good future. But
munificent promises do not always lead to rich fulfilment;
and it was not long before Mrs. Farrington
gladly returned to those in whose service she
had always been promptly and handsomely paid.</p>

<p>Fanny's style was novel and sparkling, if not
very refined, and her fame sprang up almost in a
night-time. Messrs. Derby &amp; Miller, booksellers,
of Auburn, N. Y., had the shrewdness to see that
a volume of her sketches would be apt to make a
stir in the market, and wrote to us for information
touching her real name and address. We replied
that we were not then at liberty to divulge the
name, but that any communications directed to our
care would reach her. A correspondence was at
once opened, and Mrs. Farrington was offered four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
hundred dollars for sufficient material for a volume&mdash;or,
if she preferred, ten cents a copy on every
edition printed.</p>

<p>Now four hundred dollars cash, was tempting.
It would purchase a rich dress, a dashing shawl,
"several pairs of gaiter-boots," and numerous boxes
of those sovereign preparations, noted for the qualities
that "impart a natural beauty to the complexion."
In accordance with our advice, however,
(for we foresaw a large sale for the book,) she
resolved to risk a little, in the hope that much
might be gained, and accept the commission of ten
cents a copy. The volume was easily thrown
together, being compiled principally from the files
of the Olive Branch and the True Flag. It was
stereotyped at the New-England Foundry, in this
city, and all the proof-sheets passed through our
hands.</p>

<p>At this time, Mrs. Farrington and her youngest
child, "little Ella," boarded with a respectable
family, in the spacious brick dwelling-house,
No. 642 Washington-street; her eldest daughter
residing with her grandfather Eldredge. Fanny
occupied an elegant suite of rooms on the second
floor. The parlor was sumptuously furnished;
chairs of solid mahogany, covered with velvet&mdash;with
centre-table, sofa, carpet, &amp;c., of corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
richness. The numerous visitors had no reason
to suspect that all these luxuries were only poverty
in disguise. Nor would one readily imagine that
the plump Ella and her blooming mother were
accustomed to breakfast on shadowy dishes of
hope, have the same served up, cold, for dinner,
and then go supperless to bed. The landlady
had an excellent reputation for liberality and
kindness, and looked like anything but the cruel
ogress represented in Fanny's writings. The fact
is&mdash;whatever may be said to the contrary by
Fanny and her especial sympathizers,&mdash;she was
at this time living in a style of luxury and
elegance which would have reflected no discredit
upon any lady of fashion. There may
be some good reason for concealing this suggestive
fact, but we cannot discover any.</p>

<p>"Fern Leaves, from Fanny's Portfolio"&mdash;the
last part of the title originated with ourselves,
and was adopted by Fanny&mdash;finally made its
appearance. She was fortunate in her publishers.
Never was book advertised so lavishly. No
expense of time, money, or tact, was spared, to
create a sensation and great sales. The result is
known; Fanny had occasion to thank us for our
counsel; her commission amounted to several
thousand dollars. Flushed with success, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
moved from our sober, puritanic town, to the
gay metropolis of New-York. But such reputations
are short-lived. "Little Ferns" followed,
and met with but a moderate sale. A second
series of Leaves was then published&mdash;but "oh,
what a falling off was there!" The demand for
the book was quite limited.</p>

<h2>IX.<br /><a name="chap_IX" id="chap_IX"></a>

FANNY FERN IN CHURCH.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
During Fanny Fern's residence in Boston she
was a regular attendant at the Park-street
(Orthodox) church. Undoubtedly this circumstance
arose from a strong sentiment of natural
affection. Not being on particularly intimate
terms with her family, it was without doubt a
great pleasure to catch such stray glimpses of
their well-known faces as might be obtained
under the lofty dome of their favorite church.</p>

<p>It must have been by accident that she strayed
away, one Sunday, from the well-beaten Calvinistic
path into the new Music Hall, to listen to
the eloquence of Theodore Parker. We regret,
however, that she labored under a misconception
with regard to the character of this church.
Meting out justice to all, we must admit that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
is the most democratic place of the kind in
Boston. Black and white, rich or poor, alike
are welcome. The seats are free, in pursuance
of the old adage, "first come, first served." Not
here, as in too many of our churches, is the
Christian gospel, "Son, give me thy heart,"
perverted by the man with the black velvet bag
into "Son, give me thy cash!" The contribution
box, that terror to church-goers, is very rarely
encountered, the expenses being defrayed by
voluntary yearly subscriptions. But Fanny, regardless
of these facts, must be held responsible
for the sketch which follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"Do you call <i>this</i> a church? Well, I heard a
prima dona here a few nights ago; and bright
eyes sparkled, and waving ringlets kept time to
moving fans; and opera-glasses and ogling, and
fashion and folly reigned for the nonce triumphant.
<i>I</i> can't forget it; I can't get up any devotion
<i>here</i>, under these latticed balconies, with their
fashionable freight. Now if it was a good old
country church, with a cracked bell and unhewn
rafters, a pine pulpit, with the honest sun staring
in through the windows, a pitch-pipe in the gallery,
and a few hob-nailed rustics scattered round
in the uncushioned seats, I should feel all right;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
but my soul is in fetters here; it won't soar&mdash;its
wings are earth-clipped. Things are all too fine!
Nobody can come in at that door, whose hat and
coat and bonnet are not fashionably cut. The
poor man (minus a Sunday suit) might lean on his
staff in the porch, a long while, before he'd dare
venture in, to pick up <i>his</i> crumb of the Bread of
Life. But, thank God, the unspoken prayer of
penitence may wing its way to the Eternal
Throne, though our mocking church-spires point
only with <i>aristocratic fingers</i> to the <i>rich man's
heaven</i>.</p>

<p>"That hymn was beautifully read; there's poetry
in the preacher's soul. Now he takes his seat by
the reading-desk; now he crosses the platform,
and offers his hymn-book to a female who has just
entered. What right has <i>he</i> to know there was a
woman in the house? Let the bonnets find their
own hymns&mdash;'tisn't clerical!</p>

<p>"Well, I take a listening attitude, and try to
believe I am in church. I hear a great many original,
a great many <i>startling</i> things said. I see the
gauntlet thrown at the dear old orthodox Calvinistic
sentiments which I nursed in, with my mother's
milk, and which (please God) I'll cling to till I die.
I see the polished blade of satire glittering in the
air, followed by curious, eager, youthful eyes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
which gladly see the searching 'Sword of the
Spirit' parried. Meaning glances&mdash;smothered
smiles, and approving nods, follow the witty clerical
sally. The author pauses to mark the effect,
and his face says&mdash;That stroke <i>tells</i>! and so it did,
for 'the Athenians' are not all dead, who 'love
to see and hear some new thing.' But he has
another arrow in his quiver. How his features
soften&mdash;his voice is low and thrilling, his imagery
beautiful and touching. He speaks of human
love; he touches skilfully a chord to which
every heart vibrates; and stern manhood is struggling
with his tears, ere his smiles are chased away.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's intellect there&mdash;there's poetry
there&mdash;there's genius there; but I remember Gethsemane&mdash;I
forget not Cavalry! I know the
'rocks were rent' and the 'heavens darkened,'
and 'the stone rolled away;' and a cold chill
strikes to my heart when I hear 'Jesus of Nazareth'
lightly mentioned.</p>

<p>"Oh, what are intellect, and poetry, and genius,
when with Jewish voice they cry, '<i>Away with</i>
<span class="smcap">Him</span>!'</p>

<p>"'With Mary,' let me 'bathe his feet with my
tears, and wipe them with the hairs of my head.'</p>

<p>"And so, I 'went away sorrowful,' that this
human teacher, with such great intellectual possessions,
should yet 'lack the <i>one thing needful</i>.'"
</p>

FANNY FERN IN BROADWAY.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
"Ha! there she comes, Ned!" says Mr. Augustus
Smallcane, lounging on the arm of his
friend.</p>

<p>"Mag-nif-i-cent!" drawls Mr. Tapwit, putting
his glass in his eye. "What a bust!"</p>

<p>"Isn't that a gait, Ned!"</p>

<p>"It's a-door-able!"</p>

<p>Mr. Tapwit chuckled, to let Mr. Smallcane see
that a pun was intended. Mr. Smallcane recognized
it with an "O, don't now, Ned!"</p>

<p>"Won't we have a splendid sight at her?" exclaimed
Mr. Tapwit. "Crowd this way. What
a figure!"</p>

<p>"What a foot!" adds Smallcane.</p>

<p>And the gentlemen continue to stare and make
remarks while the lady passes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>Does she care? She looks as if she liked it!
She is none of your feeble, timid, common-place
women. She "goes in" for sensation and effect&mdash;which
few know so well how to produce.</p>

<p>Fanny Fern&mdash;there! we didn't mean to let the
secret out; but it <i>is</i> Fanny we mean&mdash;is a full,
commanding woman. She looks high, steps high,
and carries her head high. She has light brown
hair, florid complexion, and large, blue eyes.
When she appears in company, her color verges
upon the rosy. If you talk with her in broad
daylight, she has a trick of dropping her veil, to
prevent a too close scrutiny of her features. When
her veil is up, you can see that she has a luscious
cheek, large nose, slightly aquiline, mouth of
character, if not of beauty, and a vigorous chin.
Fanny isn't handsome, and never was. But she
has a splendid form, a charming foot and ankle, a
fascinating expression, and the manners of a queen.</p>

<p>Dress and equipage are not the least part of
Fanny. She is as dependent upon these as a peacock
upon his tail. She wears black because it
becomes her better than any other color. A widow
of forty&mdash;fair&mdash;in mourning&mdash;how interesting!
Her magnificent, sweeping flounces occupy the
space of any five ordinary, uninflated females.
She moves with a great rustle and swell, majestic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>She is preceded by her eldest daughter, already
a young lady, as a sort of armor-bearer. Her
youngest child, "Ella," follows sprucely at her
heels, like a page. And so, up and down Broadway,
sails Fanny Fern, proud, haughty, ambitious,
scorned by some, admired by many&mdash;loved by
few.</p>

<h2>XI.<br /><a name="chap_XI" id="chap_XI"></a>

FANNY AT THE TREMONT HOUSE.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Good John Walter is Fanny's man-at-arms. He
is the last and most faithful of her servants.
She needs some person in that capacity, and
shrewdly manages never to be without such a
champion. She was fortunate, after many trials,
in falling upon so choice an acquisition as John
Walter.</p>

<p>Fanny cannot be accused of choosing her champion
from any such motive as personal beauty.
John isn't alarmingly handsome&mdash;not half so
beautiful as he is good. Of tall and gaunt figure,
with a lean-and-hungry-Cassius look, bran-like
eyes, an oyster-like open to his mouth, fiery hair,
an incendiary whisker, a windy manner of talking,
and a gaseous atmosphere pervading his person
generally&mdash;oh, no! Fanny couldn't have chosen
John for his beauty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>John's championship never shone with more
dazzling lustre, than on his visit to Boston, in her
train, last summer. He came like the very Napoleon
of snobs. Boston was to be taken by storm.
"The three-hilled city," said John, "shall bow
down at our coming." "John," answered Fanny,
"I regard you as a prophet. You are a man of
sense. The three hills shall bow down."</p>

<p>They fortified themselves in the Sebastopol of
the Tremont House,&mdash;that stronghold so formidable
to turkey,&mdash;and sent forth their proclamations.
But, somehow, there was no movement of the
three-hilled city. Not a block trembled. Not a
brick stirred. Fanny began to chafe. In vain
she searched the columns of the daily papers, to
find complimentary notices of her arrival. Not a
word on the subject. She, who expected a triumph
equal to Jenny Lind's, found herself of no
more account in the three-hilled city, whose duty
it was to bow down, than the wife of John Smith,
the joiner, who went on at the same time to hunt
up a second cousin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile good John Walter exerted himself.
In his windiest manner, he thrust that lank figure
of his into every nook and corner, where he hoped
to generate a little interest in his famous <i>protégée</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>"She's come!" whispered John mysteriously, in
the ear of an influential editor.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the editor, "has she?" and went
on with his writing.</p>

<p>"She is at the Tremont House," resumed John,
with an air of vast importance, "where she receives
her friends. The rush to see her is very
great, and we have to resort to every means to
keep the multitude at bay. You, of course, would
be a privileged one, and I should be happy to
introduce you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the editor, as he dipped his
pen.</p>

<p>"Do you know,"&mdash;John began to bluster&mdash;"there
are vipers in human form, in this city,
who have dared to sting that woman's reputation?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the kind," replied the
editor.</p>

<p>"You ought to know it; and I am authorized
to say this: Fanny expects her friends to vindicate
her character, and crush these vipers. There
is that rascal, Mr. Blank&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Blank is a friend of mine, sir."</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;John waxed bombastic&mdash;"You cannot
be a friend of his and a friend of Fanny Fern's.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
He said, in his paper, that she has a husband
living&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which is true, I believe," remarked the
editor, quietly.</p>

<p>"But sir"&mdash;here John choked&mdash;"she is a
<i>woman</i>, and no <i>gentleman</i> will make remarks of
the kind about a <span class="smcap">WOMAN</span>,&mdash;a woman, sir, is sacred;
and Fanny Fern is one of the noblest of
her sex. From your character as an editor and a
man, I had every reason to believe that you
would not hesitate to espouse her cause&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Walter," interrupted the editor, "your assumption
is somewhat astounding, but it has not
quite taken away my breath&mdash;I have still a modest
word to say. I do not see that it is my duty to go
and cudgel Mr. Blank, nor do I consider the inducement
you hold out, quite sufficient to authorize me
to engage in any quarrels except my own. I will
not trouble you to introduce me to Miss Fern. I
wish you a good morning, sir!"</p>

<p>John varied his manner with different people.
To some he was insinuating and smooth; to others,
bluff and lowering; but all his efforts were unsuccessful.
Nobody would go and whip Mr. Blank;
nobody cared much about meeting Fanny Fern.
And here let us not be misunderstood. It was no
fault of John's, that he did not succeed. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
zealous to the last degree. Still less was it Fanny's
fault. She was, as he expressed it, "the noblest of
her sex." The truth is,&mdash;and to the shame of that
city be it spoken,&mdash;there was no Don Quixote in
Boston! If Boston could have boasted of so much
chivalry, Mr. Blank would have been cudgelled,
and Fanny avenged.</p>

<p>Having utterly failed to create any kind of a sensation,&mdash;having
waited in vain to "receive friends"
at the Tremont,&mdash;it was judged expedient to make
a grand sally upon the town. An open barouche
was accordingly ordered, and Fanny, richly attired,
and attended by noble John Walter, rode ostentatiously
through the streets. A kind of sensation
was produced,&mdash;but not the right kind. People
looked, and laughed, and winked. Some said,
"Lucky John Walter!" Others, who knew Fanny,
said, "Poor John Walter!" Still Fanny was let
alone; nobody troubled her; the world turned
round, and Boston turned with it, the same; and
Mr. Blank remains uncudgelled to this day.</p>

<p>And so Fanny and the redoubtable John made
haste to evacuate their Sebastopol, withdrawing
their forces quietly, and returned, inglorious, to
New York.</p>

A KEY TO "RUTH HALL."</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Fanny Fern's latest literary effort is the
production of a novel entitled "Ruth Hall."
Much curiosity has been excited in the minds of
the public as to the originals of her various portraitures.
It will be fully satisfied by the perusal
of the following criticism from the pen of an able
reviewer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Wouldn't I call things by their right names? Would
I praise a book because a woman wrote it?"&mdash;<i>Ruth Hall</i>,
p. 307.</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
"We have called Fanny Fern a literary star.
We should qualify the expression. There is no
clear, strong lustre, no steady splendor, no mild,
benignant twinkle, to Fanny. She flashed into
our sky like a meteor, seemingly larger than Jupiter,
and for the moment more ruddy than Venus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
more flaming than any planet or fixed star. Or
perhaps we should liken her to a rocket&mdash;going up
with a great rush and whiz, then paling, dying,
falling, and finishing up with a loud, angry pop,
and a sudden shower of little fiery tadpoles, dropping
on the head of her enemies.</p>

<p>"The 'loud, angry pop' came with the publication
of her last work, 'Ruth Hall,'&mdash;a book that
appears to have been exploded in a fit of desperation,
to revive the writer's sinking fame, and to
revenge herself on her relatives, and everybody
she imagines ever injured her. Fortunately, the
rockets' fiery droppings are harmless as moonbeams,
and there is little but hiss, and whiz, and
crack, to its anger;&mdash;else some very respectable
families had been blown to atoms, and entirely
devoured and eaten up forever by the fiery tadpoles.</p>

<p>"How we used to admire Fanny! We never,
indeed, saw much to love in her writings, but the
snap, and vigor, and originality of her style, was
truly refreshing. We could never sufficiently
praise these qualities in her early sketches. Her
power was partly owing to native genius, partly to
the circumstances of her life. She was a full-grown
woman when she began to write. The age
of feeble sentimentalism was passed. She had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
seen the world; enjoyed society; known adversity.
She had been twice a wife, and twice a mother;
had lost one husband by death, and another
by&mdash;no matter what. In years she was forty; in
experience at least a hundred and forty. And all
this life and knowledge she had kept bottled up,
like old wine. How it sparkled and foamed when
the wires were cut and the cork blown out! She
poured off those first sketches, bubbling, frothing,
effervescing, like prime champagne newly opened.
Wine of this quality soon deadens; but Fanny
kept pouring out, determined to make up in quantity
what was wanting in flavor; and now&mdash;in
'Ruth Hall'&mdash;she has squeezed the bottle and
flung it at the heads of the public.</p>

<p>"Speaking of this queer book, the New York
Courier says, 'If the writer ever showed the manuscript
to her friends, they acted most cruelly towards
her, in not advising her to throw it into the
fire.' We think so too. We have never seen so
sad a revelation of a woman's heart. There are
some flashes of genius in the book, but there are
more flashes of that unmentionable fire, supposed
to be familiar to wicked souls.</p>

<p>"The principal characters in Ruth Hall bristle
all over with iron spikes of selfishness and cruelty.
The able critic of the Boston Post declares that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
'art would never admit such stony-hearted monsters
in a story of real life.' Now, 'Ruth Hall' is
understood to be an autobiography. That it was
intended as such by the writer, there can be no
doubt in the mind of any person who knows her
and reads her book. Following this view of the
subject, we have, first and foremost among the
monsters, Fanny's own father. He is the 'old
Ellet' of the story&mdash;a man who 'thinks more of
one cent than of any child he ever had;' who
coldly leaves his daughter and grandchildren to
suffer almost the extremes of want and privation;
who would not, indeed, throw them a crumb, were
it not that, as a church-member, he has a 'Christian
reputation to sustain,' and fears public opinion.
The caricature is gross and awful. Yet it is not
even a caricature. Fanny (Ruth Hall) has daubed
the hideous picture of an impossible character, and
scrawled beneath it the angry words, 'This is my
father! let all the world see and abhor him!' O,
Goneril! O, Regan! could woman's hate do more?
Oh, dear and sweet revenge upon a parent! because,
forsooth, the white-haired old man, who, even now,
totters daily up his office stairs to earn a livelihood,
possessed too much calm wisdom to impoverish
himself in order that she might sit a queen&mdash;because
he deemed it sufficient, in all love and justice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
to support her comfortably, as his means
afforded&mdash;because her own indiscretions, and extravagant
and unreasonable demands, had called
down upon her head deserved severity and reproof&mdash;this
is the fire kindled in her heart! We are
sorry to speak in this strain. But if we speak at
all, we must utter what justice and truth call out
of us. Even were Mrs. Farrington's charges
against her father well-founded, we could not but
cry out in condemnation of the parricidal spirit
that seeks so devilish a revenge.</p>

<p>"Her first husband's father, the late Dr. Eldredge,
meets with a similar treatment. The grave
that has closed over him could not shield his breast
from the tearing claws of the vampire of vengeance.
He figures as Dr. Hall&mdash;just such another unfeeling,
unnatural, impossible monster, as the old man
Ellet. Mrs. Hall (Fanny's mother-in-law, Mrs. Eldredge,)
is a slice from the same raw material, with
the addition of a little feminine salt and pepper.
Fanny had an opportunity to write something of
her own spirit in 'Mrs. Hall'&mdash;thus relieving the
deadness of the character with occasional sparks
of real human nature.</p>

<p>"Mr. N. P. Willis appears in the book as Mr.
Hyacinth Ellet&mdash;'a mincing, conceited, tip-toeing,
be-curled, be-perfumed popinjay.' Like the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
monsters, he has not a grain of heart in his composition.
Such a burlesque of a gentleman so
well known for his fine qualities of heart and
mind as Mr. N. P. Willis, is simply disgusting.
It is too coarse and flat to be tolerated even in a
farce.</p>

<p>"Other monsters in the book may be briefly
alluded to. The Millets are the&mdash;&mdash;s,&mdash;represented
as horrid people, of course, being so unfortunate
as to be related to Fanny. Mr. Lescom, editor of
the 'Standard,' is the late Mr. Norris, of the
Olive Branch. The True Flag is personified as
'Mr. Tibbets.'</p>

<p>"Now with regard to the angels in the book.
First, of course, is Fanny herself. She is 'Ruth
Hall'&mdash;a perfect celestial. We are surprised that
any person, whose judgment was not altogether
swallowed up in vanity and egotism, should have
made so bald and sickening an attempt at self-exaltation.
Ruth is a model wife, a model mother,
a model widow, a model saint. She is very beautiful,
and a great genius. There was never a
woman on earth until Ruth was let down out of
heaven. What a capital joke, that so rare a
creation should have been born the daughter of
old Ellet, and the sister of Hyacinth!</p>

<p>"'Harry Hall' is the name given to Fanny's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
first husband. It is a singular fact, by the way,
that no allusion is made to her second marriage.
Why is Mrs. Farrington so anxious to suppress
the fact, and the subject of her divorce? She
should not have neglected so good an opportunity
to give Mr. F., what in the vulgar idiom is termed
'fits.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Horace Gates, Hyacinth's assistant, on the
'Irving Magazine,' is Mr. J. Parton, late of the
Home Journal. Mr. Parton has recently written a
book for Fanny's new publishers, so she thought
proper to puff him. Mr. P. is a talented writer,
and may, for aught we know, be an excellent
man; but he is unfortunate in sitting for the
portrait of Mr. Horace Gates. We should prefer
anything rather than praise from such a quarter.</p>

<p>"But of all the overdone specimens of goodness,
the character of virtuous John Walter is the most
ridiculous to those who know the original. John
Walter is&mdash;&mdash;laugh, ye gods! and hold your
sides!&mdash;is&mdash;but we will spare the poor man's
blushes. This pure and fragrant gentleman&mdash;who,
by the way, never knew Fanny until after
the establishment of her reputation, and her
contract with Derby &amp; Miller, for the publication
of 'Fern Leaves'&mdash;has since devoted himself to
her service, contented to lick what crumbs may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
fall to him from her table, as a reward for his
brave championship. He 'puts through' the
newspaper puffing which heralds her books, acting
as her counsellor, companion, and gentleman
friend generally&mdash;and so she makes an angel of
him out of gratitude. Delicious John Walter!</p>

<p>"The story of Ruth Hall is nothing. There is
no plot whatever; no thread of interest to hold
one to its pages. There are some spicy, quite
Ferny sketches, in the first half of the volume&mdash;but
the rest is all chaff, filled in to swell the covers
to a respectable capaciousness. Towards the close,
for want of better matter, we are surfeited with
letters from people nobody cares anything about,
and a tedious phrenological examination, designed
to set off the transcendent mental, moral and
affectional qualities of that heavenly creature,
Ruth&mdash;alias Fanny!</p>

<p>"The book abounds with horrors of cruelty and
neglect&mdash;which all who are aware in what style
Mrs. Farrington used to live, know to be false&mdash;until
we come to the introduction of good John
Walter, when everybody commences laughing.
Indeed, such expressions as 'said Ruth, laughing,'
'said Mr. Walter, laughing,' 'said Katy, laughing,'
'said Ruth, beginning to laugh,' occur <i>ad
nauseam</i>. Sometimes we have 'said Ruth, smiling,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
which amounts to the same thing. And so
the book draws to a verbose and feeble close. We
are glad to have shut it up, never to open it again.
We love not these bad-hearted books. Let us then
hasten to take leave of this one, and of Fanny
Fern, forever. It was no agreeable task we had
to do, but we have done it conscientiously and
faithfully; and here let it end."</p>

A WORD ABOUT N. P. WILLIS.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Of the command, "Honor thy father and mother,"
says the Boston Transcript, <i>Ruth Hall</i>
has been a significant reminder, to those who
know the excellent man vilified in that novel
as the heroine's father, and admitted in many
ways to be intended by "Fanny Fern" as a picture
of her own father, Mr. Willis. How differently
he is looked upon by his other children it is
a relief to humanity to know, and we are glad to
be able to copy from the "Youth's Companion," the
paper which Mr. Willis publishes in his declining
years, the following lines addressed to him by his
son, N. P. Willis, the brother of "Fanny Fern."

IDEAS ABOUT BABIES.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Fanny's sentiments on this subject are decidedly
contradictory. If one were to read any
two of her articles, without a definite knowledge
of her circumstances, they would be at a loss to
determine whether she is maid or matron. The
language of the first article which we shall quote
is certainly very <i>anti</i>-motherly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Folly</span>&mdash;For girls to expect to be happy without marriage.
Every woman was made for a mother, consequently,
babies are as necessary to their 'peace of mind,' as health.
If you wish to look at melancholy and indigestion, look at an
old maid. If you would take a peep at sunshine, look in the
face of a young mother."</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
"Now I <i>won't stand that</i>! I'm an old maid myself;
and I'm neither melancholy nor indigestible!
My '<span class="smcap">PIECE</span> <i>of mind</i>' I'm going to give you, (in a
minute!) and I never want to <i>touch</i> a baby except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
with a <i>pair of tongs</i>! 'Young mothers and sunshine!'
Worn to fiddle-strings before they are
twenty-five! When an old lover turns up he
thinks he sees his grandmother, instead of the
dear little Mary who used to make him feel as if
he should crawl out of the toes of his boots! Yes!
my mind is <i>quite</i> made up about <i>matrimony;</i> but
as to the '<i>babies</i>,' (sometimes I think, and then
again I don't know!) but on <i>the whole I believe</i> I
consider 'em a d&mdash;&mdash;ecided humbug! It's a <i>one-sided</i>
partnership, this marriage! the <i>wife casts up
all the accounts</i>!</p>

<p>"'Husband' gets up in the morning and pays
his '<i>devours</i>' to the looking-glass; curls his fine
head of hair; puts on an immaculate shirt-bosom;
ties an excruciating cravat; sprinkles his handkerchief
with cologne; stows away a French roll, an
egg, and a cup of coffee; gets into the omnibus,
looks <i>slantendicular</i> at the pretty girls, and makes
love between the pauses of business during the
forenoon <i>generally</i>. Wife must 'hermetically seal'
the windows and exclude all the fresh air, (because
the baby had the 'snuffles' in the night;)
and sits gasping down to the table more dead than
alive, to finish her breakfast. Tommy turns a
cup of hot coffee down his bosom; Juliana has
torn off the string of her school-bonnet; James
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
'wants his geography covered;' Eliza can't find
her satchel; the butcher wants to know if she'd
like a joint of mutton; the milkman would like
his money; the ice man wants to speak to her
'just a minute;' the baby swallows a bean; husband
sends the boy home from the store to say <i>his
partner</i> will dine with him; the cook leaves 'all
flying,' to go to her 'sister's dead baby's wake,'
and husband's thin coat must be ironed before
noon. '<i>Sunshine and young mothers!!</i>' Where's
my smelling-bottle?"
</p>

<p>To the foregoing denunciation of the infant-angels,
the following defence furnishes quite a
decided contrast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Baby-carts on narrow side-walks are awful bores, especially
to a hurried business man."</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
"<i>Are</i> they? Suppose you, and a certain pair
of blue eyes, that you would give half your patrimony
to win, were <i>joint proprietors</i> of that baby!
<i>I</i> shouldn't dare to stand <i>very near</i> you, and call it
'a nuisance.' It's all very well for bachelors to
turn up their <i>single blessed</i> noses at these little dimpled
Cupids; but just wait till <i>their</i> time comes.
See 'em, the minute their name is written 'Papa,'
pull up their dickies, and strut off down street
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
as if the Commonwealth owed them a pension!
When they enter the office, see their old married
partner (to whom babies have long since ceased to
be a novelty) laugh in his sleeve at the new-fledged
dignity with which <i>that</i> baby's advent is
announced! How perfectly astonished they feel
that they should have been so infatuated as not to
perceive that a man is a <i>perfect cypher</i> till he is at
the head of a family! How frequently one may
see them now, looking in at the shop windows,
with intense interest, at little hats, coral and bells,
and baby-jumpers. How they love to come home
to dinner, and press that little velvet cheek to
their <i>business faces</i>! Was there ever music <i>half</i> so
sweet to their ear, as its <i>first lisped 'Papa'</i>? Oh,
how closely and imperceptibly, one by one, that
little plant winds its tendrils round the parent
stem! How anxiously they hang over its cradle
when the cheek flushes and the lip is fever-parched;
and how wide, and deep, and long a
shadow in their happy homes, its <i>little grave</i> would
cast!</p>

<p>"My <span class="smcap">DEAR</span> sir, depend upon it, <i>one's own baby is
never</i> '<i>a nuisance</i>.' <i>Love</i> heralds its birth."
</p>

<p>It's just possible though, that Fanny may be
actuated by a spirit of sheer contradiction; for,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
happening in some of her readings, to come across
Tupper's declaration, that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"A babe in the house is a well-spring of pleasure,"</p>
</div>

<p>she takes up the gauntlet, and holds forth in the
following vigorous style:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"Now, Mr. Tupper, allow me to ask you, did
you ever <i>own</i> a baby? I <i>meant</i> to say, did you
ever <i>have</i> one? Because I knew a woman <i>once</i> that
<i>had</i>; and shall use the privilege of an American
'<i>star and stripe</i>' female, to tell you that <i>that</i> English
sentiment of yours, <i>won't pass this side the water</i>!</p>

<p>"Ain't we a <span class="smcap">LITTLE</span> the smartest people on the
face of the earth? and if any country <i>could</i> grow
decent babies, wouldn't it be <i>America</i>? Yes, SIR!
but I tell you, it's my solemn conviction that they
are nothing more nor less than a '<i>well-spring</i>' of
<i>botheration</i>, wherever they are raised. Don't <i>I</i>
know? Didn't that shapeless, flimsy, flappy little
nuisance I allude to, rule the house from garret to
cellar before it was a month old? Wasn't it entirely
at <i>its</i> option, whether the mother dined at 2
o'clock at noon, or 2 at night? In fact, whether
she dined at all? Didn't the little wretch keep its
lack-lustre eyes fixed on her, and the minute she
turned her back upon it and moved towards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
door, contrive to poke one eye half out with its
fist, or get its toes twisted into a knot, or some
such infantile stratagem to attract attention?
Didn't it know, by <i>instinct</i>, whenever she had an
invitation to ride, or walk, or visit? and get up a
fit of sham distress to knock it all in the head?
Didn't she throw away dozens of pairs of good shoes
because they creaked? Did she <i>ever</i> know what
she was to be allowed to do the next minute?</p>

<p>"'<i>Well-spring of pleasure!</i>' Ha! ha! Ask her
husband, Tom! Didn't he have to emigrate up
two flights of stairs because it screeched so incessantly
nights, that it unfitted him for business next
day? He's <i>very</i> fond of babies; <span class="smcap">HE</span> is!</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Tupper, we won't mention creeping
time&mdash;when skeins of yarn, and pins, and darning
needles are swallowed, with a horrifying ravenousness
suggestive of a 'stomach pump;' or its first
essays at walking, when it navigates the carpet
like a sailor fresh from 'board ship;' raising bumps
never marked down on any phrenological chart!
or clutching at the corner of the tablecloth, dragging
off inkstands, vases, annuals, and '<i>Proverbial
Philosophys</i>,' with an edifying promiscuousness!
Then, making for the open door, and taking a 'flying
leap' down two pairs of stairs, to the astonishment
of John, Betty and Sally!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Martin Farquhar Tupper, 'philosophize'
as beautifully as <i>only you know how</i>, but
<i>take an American woman's advice</i>, and don't mention
babies! unless you'll sketch from <i>life</i> as <i>I</i> do!
You needn't stand up for <i>English babies</i>; they're
<i>all alike</i>, from Queen Victoria's <span class="smcap">DOWN</span> to Mike
O'Flaherty's, or <span class="smcap">UP</span> to American babies!</p>

<p>"I'm astonished at you, Mr. Tupper! a <i>poet</i> and
a <span class="smcap">HANDSOME</span> poet, too!! I'm surprised. <i>I</i> am!"

PRAISE FROM A WOMAN.</h2>

Fanny always <i>was</i> grateful. This well-known
fact is humorously exemplified in the following
article, referring to Mrs. H. Marion Stephens. This
lady, in her "Town-Talk," for the Boston Times,
made a few graceful allusions to Fanny's wit and
genius, and this friendly tribute gave birth to</p>

<p class="center">

THE REMARKABLE HISTORY OF
JEMMY JESSAMY.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>"Jemmy Jessamy," writes Fanny Fern, "was
a double-distilled old bachelor. He had occupied
the same quarters at &mdash;&mdash; Hotel for five-and-twenty
years. The chamber-maid that 'cleared
up' No. 25, dared not, at the price of her scalp,
misplace a boot or a tooth-brush. If his breakfast
was brought up five minutes before the time, it
was ordered down again&mdash;and woe to the luckless
waiter who brought him hot water when he spoke
for cold, or failed to transmit, with telegraphic
speed, any card or parcel left at the bar. The first
thing <i>he</i> knew he didn't know <i>nothing</i>. In other
words, Jemmy saved him the trouble of going
down stairs, by landing him, 'on his own hook,'
(nolens volens) in the lower entry.</p>

<p>"Jemmy took two or three hours to <i>make himself</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
<i>up</i> in the morning, emerging from his shell at
10 o'clock in the forenoon, a perfect Beau Brummell.
The most fastidious taste could detect no
flaw; the most critical or censorious eye no foppery.
His figure was matchless, or his tailor, or
both together; and his coats always of a shade
of color unattainable by any one but Jemmy.
Last, not least, he rejoiced in a set of dickies that
left him at perfect liberty to look east, west, north
or south, without cutting his ears off! He never
appeared in public, 'en dishabille,' either of body
or mind. Both were, at such times, in their holiday
suit.</p>

<p>"Now it was very selfish in Jemmy to 'waste
his sweetness on the desert air,' for so many years;
but he had two good reasons for it. The first was
that he considered himself too bright a jewel to be
in the possession of any one woman exclusively.
The next was, he was terribly afraid of being
taken in. He never made a call on a <i>single</i>
woman without taking some male acquaintance
(not too attractive) to neutralize the force of the
compliment. A bright eye or a pretty ankle gave
him spasms. He couldn't live away from their
owners, and he was afraid to go too near them.</p>

<p>"He was most at his ease in a large family of sisters,
where he could sprinkle about his attentions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
and gallantries in hom&oelig;opathic doses; or in the
society of married ladies, where a man stands in no
fear of being asked "<i>his intentions</i>."</p>

<p>"Susy &mdash;&mdash; was the bright, particular star in <i>this</i>
firmament. She was always in choice spirits, sparkling
as a bottle of champagne, well-dressed, good-tempered,
always ready for a drive, a walk, a sail
or a pic-nic, and always the belle of the party.</p>

<p>"She was visiting at the house of a friend; and
Jemmy felt himself so <i>safe</i> there. The newest
piece of music, the most fragrant of Gibbens' bouquets,
the last of Dickens's perpetrations, found
their way to "Barley Place, No. 5." Susy hemmed
three splendid neck-ties, with her own fair fingers;
mended the little rips in his gloves, (that he had
amused himself <i>making</i> for her when he sat alone
in his room,) and told him, confidentially, how to
trim his moustache and where to lay the pruning-knife
to his whiskers. Jemmy was a lucky man!</p>

<p>"Jem," said Tom Lane, one night, as they sat
smoking their cigars with their feet ten degrees
higher than their heads, "how much longer are you
going to trifle with that little widow? Why don't
you ask her and done with it?"</p>

<p>"Widow! ask her! done with it!" said Jem,
with a stupid stare, as his cigar fell into the ashes.
"They said 'her husband was absent.'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>"Absent! Ha! ha! his tombstone will tell you
about that!"</p>

<p>"I'm ruined," said Jem, "<i>ruined</i>! I have driven
her out; walked with her, sailed with her, praised
her eyes and hair, sent her bouquets, and music,
and poetry; I've&mdash;I've done everything, Tom.
What's to be done? I won't be married. I'd as
lief be hung;" and pronouncing the latter part of
the word <i>condemnation</i>, rather audibly, he rushed
into the open air to take breath!</p>

<p>"The next day the following item appeared in the
newspapers:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mysterious.</span>&mdash;The admirers of James Jessamy,
Esq., will be pained to learn of his sudden and unaccountable
disappearance from the &mdash;&mdash; Hotel.
No clue has as yet been discovered of his whereabouts.
His papers, books and wearing-apparel, are
in safe keeping for his relatives, and may be had on
application to Sam Springle, &mdash;&mdash; Hotel."

JEMMY JESSAMY'S DEFENCE.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
To Fanny Fern.&mdash;<i>Miss Fern</i>: Your wanton
and unprovoked attack upon me, in the last edition
of the "True Flag," headed "Look before you
Leap," is a <i>leetle</i> more than I can stand. I should
like to know what on earth has induced you to expend
your electricity upon "Jemmy Jessamy, the
double-distilled bachelor?" Calling me by name,
and thus setting me up as a public mark, and proclaiming
just the number of years I have boarded
in "&mdash;&mdash; Hotel, No. 25," and then heralding my
peculiarities in regard to the chamber-maid, has put
me in no enviable predicament. I begin to think it
is high time I knew "something."</p>

<p>My hour for rising, I acknowledge, is ten A. M.
I am not, then, the perfect "Beau Brummell" you
have described; for I have never obtruded my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
calls upon anybody until ten o'clock, by my double
repeater. Well, if I was skittish about approaching
women, formerly, what must I be now, since
your virago-tongue has used me up by piecemeal!
Talking about my "dickeys" sitting comfortably!
What if I <i>do</i> allow myself a commendable latitude
for turning every way? When <i>such</i> weather-cocks
are in the market, it behooves us to "look before
we leap." Besides, I have never taxed a female
eye to stitch a dickey, sew on a button, make a shirt,
or repair an overcoat since I have been in the above
hotel. My tailor has always been my seamstress:
and his bills, like some of the married fraternity,
do not remain <i>unpaid</i>. But what right had you to
assign my reasons for remaining single, and bestowing
my attentions in "hom&oelig;opathic doses upon a
whole family of sisters?"</p>

<p>Then I am served up at "No. 5 Barley
Place," and a game is made about myself and
the widow "Susy." I am represented as playing
the part of a lover, supposing her a married lady.
She never sewed a rip in my glove, nor cut or
curled a single hair of my moustaches in her life.
To be sure, Tom Lane is a joking fellow, and he
<i>did</i> talk about her husband's tombstone; but it
was all gas, and, as I thought, ended in smoke.</p>

<p>But, last of all, I am described as absconding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
from my hotel. Heavens! what a tongue you
have got. Hadn't I a right to go South to cure a
consumption, without a strange woman's meddling
about it? While I was there, however, Miss Fan,
I heard of a place just suited to your capacities.
An editor advertised for a partner "that could
write out thunder and lightning at a stroke." I
thought of you, and added, I knew one that could
do that, and throw a powerful deluge along with
it. This is evidently your latitude. People at
the South indulge in personalities, and then
challenge each other for a duel. In this way, you
would be spared many of your random shots.</p>

<p>The time was, when I seriously thought of the
subject of marriage. I have bothered over the
subject, whether women are really what they
appear, until I am satisfied. If <i>you</i> are an untamed,
undisguised, plain representative of the
sex, may heaven protect all future Caudles from
such emblems of affection! If I am an old
bachelor, I am determined to wear the breeches
myself. You need not dream about a codicil
being attached to my will,&mdash;for your last attack
has completely and forever estranged you from all
claims, human or divine on</p>

THE GOVERNESS.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
The following tale is Fanny Fern's earliest
attempt at a long story, now for the first time
given to the world within the covers of a book.</p>

<p>"'If you please, ma'am, a young woman in the
hall, dressed in mourning, wishes to speak with
you.' The lady addressed might have been, (we
are aware we are treading on debatable ground,)
about thirty-eight years of age. Time, that had
spared her the attraction of a graceful, pliant form,
had robbed her blue eyes of their lustre, and
thinned her flaxen tresses. She still rejoiced,
however, in a pair of diminutive feet and ankles,
which she considered it a great sin to 'hide under
a bushel,' and had a way of her own of exhibiting
on all occasions, known only to the ingenuity of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
practised coquette, or an ex-belle. She raised her
eyes languidly from the last new novel she was
perusing, and with the air of a victim closed the
book, as John ushered in the intruder.</p>

<p>"Slightly raising her eyebrows, she said, 'So
you are the young person who answered my
advertisement for a governess?' levelling at the
same time a scrutinizing glance upon her that
brought the color into her fair cheek. 'In
mourning, I see; very becoming, but it always
gives me the dismals to see a black dress about;
don't cry, child, people will die when their time
comes, it's a thing that can't be helped. I suppose
you understand French, German, Italian, Spanish,
and all that sort of thing, if you are a governess.
I desire Meta to be <i>fashionably</i> educated, and if
you stay, I hope you will understand your business
and be thorough, for it is a great bore to me
to look after such things. I shall want you to
clear starch my collars and ruffles, and trim my
breakfast caps; I see you look as though you
would object to this, but you won't find such a
place as this every day, and people who are driven
to the wall by necessity, and have to get their
own living, can't afford to be fastidious. Pity
you are so pretty, child; never mind, you must
keep close; you'll see no company at my house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
and I trust you are no gadder. What is your
name? Grace Clifford? very romantic! Well,
if you'd like to stay, John will show you to your
room&mdash;but pray put away that mass of curls and
wear it plain, as it looks too childish for a governess.
You needn't trouble yourself to dress for
dinner, as you will eat with Meta in the nursery.
John! Show Miss Clifford to her room.'</p>

<p>"And thither, fair reader, we will follow her.
Poor Grace! Left to herself, a sense of her utter
loneliness overpowered her, and she wept like a
child. Early left an orphan, dependent through her
childhood and youth, up to the present time, upon
relatives who made her feel each day, each hour,
how bitter was that dependence; who grudged
the bread she ate; who, envious of her beauty and
superior abilities, constantly made them the subject
of coarse jests and coarser taunts, Grace gladly
answered Mrs. Fay's advertisement, hoping for
relief from the fetters of so galling a chain. Sensitive
to a fault, she had endeavored to nerve herself
with strength to endure much that was annoying
and repulsive in the situation she sought; but
the total want of delicacy and courtesy displayed
by Mrs. Fay, her coarse allusion to her late bereavement,
(the death of a sister,) her ill-concealed envy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
of her personal charms, all combined to depress
and dishearten her.</p>

<p>"But Grace Clifford was a Christian. She had
been early called to suffer; she knew <i>who</i> had
mixed for her the cup of life, and she pushed it not
away from her lips because the ingredients were
bitter. She knew an ear that was never deaf to
the orphan's cry, and that the promise 'When
thy father and mother forsake thee,' was all her
own to claim; and she rose from her knees with a
brow calm as an angel's, a spirit girded for the
conflict, and a peace that the world knoweth not
of.</p>

<p>"Grace's patroness, Mrs. Fay, was the only
daughter of a petty shop-keeper in the village of
&mdash;&mdash;. Worshipped by doating parents for her
beauty, of which little now remained, she received
from them a showy, superficial education, which
she was taught from childhood to consider valuable
only as a stepping-stone to an establishment in
life. She contemptuously turned the cold shoulder
to her rustic admirers, one after the other. How
this human butterfly succeeded in entrapping a
matter-of-fact man, like Mr. Fay, is quite unaccountable.
Be that as it may, the honeymoon saw
in its decline the death of his love, and wearied
with her doll face and vacant mind, he sought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
after the birth of his little daughter, his chief pleasure
in the nursery, for which she entertained an
unconquerable aversion.</p>

<p>"Reader, have you never in a Summer's day
ramble stopped to admire in some secluded spot a
sweet flower that had sprung up as if by magic&mdash;rich
in color, beautiful in form, throwing unconsciously
its sweet fragrance to the winds, unappreciated,
unnoticed, uncared for, save by His eye
who painted its delicate leaves? Such a flower was
Meta Fay. Delicate, fragile as Spring's first violet,
with a brow and eyes that are seldom seen,
save where death's shadow soonest falls; and with
a mind that face belied not, earnest, thoughtful
and serious.</p>

<p>"Repulsed by her mother, who saw nothing in
that little shrinking form but a bar to the enjoyment
of her empty pleasures, doted on by a father
who was the slave of Mammon, and who, unable
to fathom the soul that looked out from the depths
of those clear eyes, lavished as a recompense for
the many unanswered questions prompted by her
restless mind, the costliest toys of childhood.
From all these would Meta turn away dissatisfied,
to clasp to her bosom the simplest daisy that decked
the meadow, or to hail with rapture the first
sweet star that came stealing forth at evening.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>"Such was Grace Clifford's pupil. All thought
of herself was soon lost in the delight of watching
her young mind develop; and if a thought of her
responsibility as its guardian sometimes startled
her, yet it also made her more watchful, more true
to her trust. A love almost like that of parent
and child grew up between them. Often, when
engaged in their studies, when Meta's love-speaking
eyes were fixed upon her young teacher, and
the flush upon her delicate cheek was coming and
vanishing like the shadows of a Summer cloud,
would Grace tremble for the frail casket that contained
so priceless a gem.</p>

<p>"Meantime, Mrs. Fay continued her treadmill
round of visiting, shopping and dressing, occasionally
looking into the nursery, quite satisfied that
her child was wonderfully improved in beauty,
and willing to take it for granted everything else
was as it should be. On one of these occasions
Meta said,</p>

<p>"'Mamma! Papa and I think Miss Clifford is a
beauty.'</p>

<p>"'Indeed!' said Mrs. Fay.</p>

<p>"'Yes, and when I pull out her comb and let all
her beautiful hair down over her shoulders, papa
says it looks like waves of gold.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Fay walked up to her husband and said, in
a hissing whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"'So this accounts for the interest you take in
the child's studies! In my opinion that Grace
Clifford, with her sly demure face, is a great flirt&mdash;I
thought she was too pretty when I engaged
her. '<i>Golden waves!</i>' and with a toss of the
head, be-tokening a domestic thunder-storm, her
ladyship left the nursery.</p>

<p>"The next day, as Grace sat busy with her work,
with Meta beside her, the child suddenly looked
up and said,</p>

<p>"'What is a <i>flirt</i>, Miss Clifford?'</p>

<p>"Grace was about to burst into a hearty laugh,
but there was a look almost amounting to distress
on Meta's face that checked her.</p>

<p>"'Why do you ask me that question, my pet?'</p>

<p>"'Oh! because mamma told papa yesterday that
<i>you</i> was a flirt, and I thought&mdash;and (the child hesitated)
it meant something <i>naughty</i>, because mamma
was so angry.'</p>

<p>"Poor Grace! The blood rushed in a torrent
over cheek, neck and brow. Meta, frightened at
the effect of her question, began to sob as if her
heart would break, when the door opened, and
Mr. Fay came in. Grace rushed precipitately past
him, and gaining her own room, burst into a passionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
flood of tears. In vain she taxed her
memory to recall an indiscreet word or action, or
anything that a jealous wife could construe into an
invasion of her matrimonial rights. The sin, if
there was any, was not forthcoming. In vain had
been all her efforts to propitiate this weak-minded
woman, by pulling away the obnoxious ringlets,
by clear starching her muslins, or trimming with
tasteful fingers her dainty little breakfast caps.
The serpent had entered Eden; and although no
'forbidden fruit' had been tasted, she none the
less clearly saw the flaming sword that was to
drive her thence. Sheltering herself under the
plea of a violent headache, she excused herself
from appearing again below, and sat until a late
hour at night, devising the best mode of leaving,
as farther stay was impossible in such a humiliating
position. She must go; <i>that</i> was plain;&mdash;but
<i>where</i>?</p>

<p>"Suddenly she was startled from her reverie by
the sound of hurrying feet in the hall. A quick
rap at the door, and a summons to Meta's room
followed. She had been taken suddenly and
alarmingly ill. Grace forgot everything in anxiety
for her darling, and hastily snatching a dressing
gown, she flew to her room. The poor child
was tossing restlessly from side to side; her little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
hands were hot and burning, and her cheeks crimsoned
with fever. Mr. Fay hastily resigned her to
Grace's care, while he went for a physician.</p>

<p>"With the tenderness of a mother she changed
the heated pillows, parted the thick curls from her
little forehead, bathed the throbbing temples, and
rendered the thousand little nameless services,
known only to the soft step, quick eye, and delicate
hand of woman.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the mother slept quietly in an adjoining
room, solacing herself that the doctor
knew better than she what was best for the child,
and fearing the effect of night vigils upon her
complexion.</p>

<p>"When Mr. Fay returned with the physician,
Meta had sunk into an uneasy slumber. Resigning
her post to him, Grace watched his countenance
with an anxious eye while he felt the pulse and
noted the breathing of her little pupil. Writing
his prescriptions, he handed them to Grace, who
had signified her intention of spending the night,
adding as he did so,</p>

<p>"'It is needless to enjoin quiet upon one who
seems so well to understand the duties of a nurse.'</p>

<p>"With a glance at his child, in which all the
father was expressed, and a grateful 'God bless
you' to Grace, Mr. Fay left the room. Shading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
the small lamp, lest it might waken the child,
Grace unhanded her rich tresses, and loosening
the girdle of her dressing gown, seated herself
beside her.</p>

<p>"Silently, slowly, pass the night watches, in the
chamber of the sick and dying! The dull ticking
of the clock, falling upon the sensitive ear of the
watcher, strikes to the throbbing heart a nameless
terror. With straining eye, its hours are counted;
with nervous hand, at the appointed time, the
healing draught is prepared for the sufferer. The
measured tread of the watchman, as he passes his
rounds beneath the windows, the distant rumble
of the stage-coach, perchance the disjointed fragment
of a song from bacchanalian lips, alone break
the solemn stillness. At such an hour, serious
thoughts like unbidden guests rush in. Life appears
like the <i>dream</i> it is; <i>Eternity</i> the <i>waking</i>;
and involuntarily the most thoughtless look up for
help to <i>Him</i>, by whom 'the hairs of our head are
all numbered.'</p>

<p>"The stars, one by one, faded away in the golden
light of morning. The sun rose fair to many an
eye that should never see its setting. Meta was
delirious. In fancy she roved with her dear
teacher in green fields, and listened to the sweet
song of birds, and was happy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>"'Do not tell me my darling will die,' said the
stricken father to the physician; then turning to
Grace, he said, almost in the form of a command,
'you know how to pray; you taught her the
way to heaven, when I could not; <i>ask for her life</i>;
God hears the angels.'</p>

<p>"'While there is life there is hope,' said the
sympathizing physician, wiping away a tear; 'all
that we can do we will, and leave the event with a
higher power.'</p>

<p>"Day after day, night after night, regardless of
food or rest, Grace kept tireless watch by the
little sufferer; the selfish mother occasionally
looking in, declaring her inability to stay in a sick-room,
and expressing her satisfaction that others
had more nerve than herself for such scenes.</p>

<p>"That day a new harp was strung, a white robe
was worn, a new song was heard in heaven. <i>On
earth, 'the child was not!'</i></p>

<p>"'Alone <i>again</i> in the world, alone with the <i>dead</i>,'
faltered Grace, as she sank insensibly by the little
corpse.</p>

<p>"Well was it for the grief-stricken father that a
new object of solicitude was before him; well for
the mother that such devotion to her dead child
had at last touched a heart so encrusted with
worldliness. All their united efforts, joined with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
the skill of the friend and physician, were needed
to rescue Grace from the grave. To an observing
eye, the interest the latter evinced for his fair
patient was not entirely professional. He had
been touched by her self-sacrificing devotion, and
her friendlessness, and each day more and more
charmed with her beauty and simplicity.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>"Softly fell the moonlight on the countless sleepers
in the vast cemetery of &mdash;&mdash;. Each tiny flower
swaying in the night-breeze was gemmed with
nature's tears. The solemn stillness was unbroken
save by the sweet note of some truant bird returning
to his leafy home. How many hearts so lately
throbbing with pain or pleasure lay there forever
stilled! There, in her unappropriated loveliness,
slept the betrothed maiden; there, the bride with
her head pillowed on golden tresses whose sunny
beauty e'en the great spoiler seemed loth to
touch; the dimpled babe that yesterday lay warm
and rosy in its mothers breast; the gray-haired
sire, weary with life's conflict, the loving wife
and mother in life's sweet prime, deaf to the wail
of her helpless babe and to the agonized cry of
its father; the faithful pastor, gone at last to hear
the 'Well done, good and faithful servant;' the
reckless youth, who with brow untouched by care,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
and limbs fashioned for strength and beauty, had
rushed unbidden into the presence of his Maker,
impatient for the summons of the 'great Reaper.'
On his tombstone, partial friends had written, 'he
sleeps in Jesus,' while underneath, (in 'the handwriting
on the wall') methought I could read,
'no murderer hath eternal life.'</p>

<p>"There lay the miser, who only in death's
agony loosened his hold of his golden god. The
widow he has made houseless, and her shivering
orphans, read the mocking falsehood on the splendid
marble that covers him, and murmur in words
that are God's own truth, 'It is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich
man to enter into the kingdom of God.'</p>

<p>"With a saddened heart I turn to inhale the
sweet breath of the flowers planted by the hand
of affection, or strewn in garlands with falling
tears over the loved and lost. Before me, shining
in the moonlight, is a marble tablet; on it I read,
'<i>Our little Meta</i>.' I advance toward it; suddenly
I see a female figure approaching, looking so
spiritual in the moonlight&mdash;with her snowy robe
and shining hair&mdash;that I could almost fancy her
an angel guarding the child's grave. She advanced
toward it, and kneeling, presses her lips to the fragrant
sod, saying in a voice of anguish,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>"'Would to God I had died for thee, my child,
my child!'</p>

<p>"A kind friend had followed Grace's footsteps.
A rich, manly voice is borne upon the air. It
shall fall like dew upon the stricken flower. Listen
to the chant!</p>

<p class="o1">'There is a Reaper whose name is Death,</p>

once frowned. Both are alike to Grace, who has
given her warm heart, 'till death do us part,' to
one who knows well how to prize the gift."</p>

ALL ABOUT SATAN.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Fanny says herself, she "knows <i>all</i> about
him." Now who in the world so fit to deliver a
discourse on the subject, as so intimate an acquaintance?
Beside, we have seen already that Fanny
is in the habit of writing about her friends.
Satan <i>might</i> think it a little unjust to be held
responsible for babies and women's rights movements,
but Fanny knows best, so here follows her
sermon, text and all:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Satan finds some mischief still</p>
<p>For idle hands to do."</p>
</div></div>

<p>"<i>To be sure he does! I know all about him!</i>
There's no knowing what <i>would</i> happen, if the
houses now-a-days were not filled up, one half
with babies and the other half with old stockings!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Then a man can tell pretty near, what his wife is
about!&mdash;sure to find her, year in and year out, in
that old calico wrapper, in that old ricketty
rocking-chair, with the last new twins in her arms,
when he wants a button sewed on his coat to go
to the opera. <i>No other way, you see!</i></p>

<p>"Women are getting <i>altogether</i> too smart now-a-days;
there <i>must</i> be a stop put to it! people are
beginning to get alarmed! I don't suppose there
has been such a universal crowing since the
roosters in Noah's ark were let out, as there was
among the editors when that '<i>Swisshelm</i>' <i>baby</i>
was born! It's none of <i>my</i> business, but it <i>did</i>
seem to me <i>rather</i> a <i>circular singumstance</i>, that she
should be cut short in her editorial career that
way! I suppose, however, that baby will grow
out of her arms one of these days, spite of fate;
and then, if there's no <i>providential interposition</i>, she
may resume her pen again. Well, I hope it will
be a <i>warning</i>! the fact is, <i>women</i> have no business
to be crowding into the editorial chair. Supposing
they <i>know</i> enough to fill it (which I <i>doubt</i>! hem!)
they oughter 'hide their light under a b'&mdash;aby!</p>

<p>"I tell you, editors <i>won't stand</i> it, to have their
masculine toes trod on that way. They'll have to
sign a 'quit claim' to their 'dickeys' by and
by! I wonder what the world's coming to!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
What do you suppose our fore<i>fathers</i> and <i>foremothers</i>
would say, to see a woman sitting up in
the editorial chair, as pert as a piper, with a pen
stuck behind her little ears? phew! I hope <i>I</i>
never shall see such a horrid sight!"</p>

WELL-KNOWN CHARACTERS.&mdash;BY FANNY
FERN.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Miss Charity Crackbone was a spinster;
not that she ever 'spun street yarn.' Oh no!
but she spun tremendous long 'yarns' with her
<i>tongue</i>, and had spun out forty years of her life in
single blessedness, in a shop at the corner of Pin
Alley, where you could purchase, for a consideration,
gingerbread and shoe-blacking, hooks-and-eyes
and cholera pills, razors and sugar candy,
crackers and castor-oil, head-brushes and butter,
small tooth combs and molasses.</p>

<p>"Not having sufficient employment in superintending
her own affairs, she very philanthropically
undertook to manage those of her neighbors; and,
like all persons of weak intellect, had an astonishing
memory for <i>little</i> things; could tell you the
very hour, of the very day, of the very week, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
month, and year, you were born; how long you
were employed in cutting your first tooth, what
tailoress had the honor of introducing you into
jacket and trowsers, and when you put on your
first long-tail coat.</p>

<p>"Miss Charity's 'outward man' was not remarkably
felicitous; her figure much resembling a
barber's pole in its proportions. She generally
preferred dresses of the flabbiest possible material,
and a very tight fit; so that her projecting bones
were no mystery, and as the skirt lacked two or
three inches of reaching the ground, it revealed a
pair of feet and ankles evidently intended more for
<i>use</i> than <i>ornament</i>. Her hair was the color of a
dirty blanket, and her eyes bore a strong resemblance
to a drop of indigo in a pan of buttermilk.</p>

<p>"'Good morning, Charity,' said a fellow gossip;
'<i>such</i> a budget of news!'</p>

<p>"Charity dropped her knitting-work, seized one
chair for her visitor, and placed herself on another
in front of her, with both elbows on her knees, and
her face as near Miss Pettingill's as possible, lest
she should lose a word; exclaiming,</p>

<p>"'For the land's sake, make haste and begin.
<i>Who did what?</i> The cat's tail pointed north this
morning, and I <i>knew</i> it was the <i>fore-end of a runner</i>
of something.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>"'I declare, I don't know which end <i>to</i> begin,'
said Pettingill; '<i>such</i> a piece of work! This is a
wicked, abominable world, Charity. You know
that Mrs. Clark?'</p>

<p>"'Land alive! don't I though? Wasn't I the
first one to tell that her husband ran off and left
her; and that she was a flirt and extravagant?
Not that I <i>knew</i> she was, myself, but I heard tell
so, and what you hear said is <i>most</i> always true.
Besides, she's pretty, and that's always against a
woman, as you and I know, Pettingill. Who ever
heard any body talk against <i>us</i>?' and she set her
arms a-kimbo as if 'pistols for two' would be sent
for, if they did! 'Well, what has the creature
done <i>now</i>, Pettingill?'</p>

<p>"'Why, you know she boards at Deacon Ephraim
Snow's&mdash;I wonder at his having her in his
house, and he a <i>deacon</i> too. But you know Mrs.
Clark has 'mazin pretty ways with her, and she's
got round him somehow. Well, you know I do
washing for his wife, and speaking of <i>that</i>, she's
horrid stingy of her soap. Well, t'other day she
sent me up garret, as it rained, to hang up the
clothes, and as I went by Mrs. Clark's room, it
struck me I'd just peep into the key-hole and listen
a bit.' Here Charity drew up her chair so close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
that the tips of their noses met; saying, in a hoarse
whisper,</p>

<p>"'What <i>did</i> you see?'</p>

<p>"'La! don't frighten me so,' said Pettingill;
'your eyes look like a cat's in the dark! I saw a
very fine-looking gentleman&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'<i>I'll warrant it</i>,' said Charity, with a triumphant
chuckle.</p>

<p>"'And I heard him say, 'Edith, dear&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Here Charity pushed back her chair and rolled
up the whites of her eyes like a duck in a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>"'Edith dear,' says he, 'rely upon me; never
heed these slanderous stories; I will be your protector.'
There, Charity, what do you think of
that?'</p>

<p>"'She is a church-member,' said Charity,
thoughtfully, 'isn't she? keep quiet, and watch
her, the hypocrite! Did you say anything about
it to Mrs. Snow, or the deacon!'</p>

<p>"'Not I,' said Pettingill; 'it would have fetched
<i>me</i> out, you know, for <i>listening</i>; but I'm convinced
the man has a '<i>canister</i>' motive in going there.'</p>

<p>"'<i>Sinister</i>,' said Charity, reprovingly, who considered
herself a scholar.</p>

<p>"'Well, <i>canister</i> or <i>sinister</i>, it makes no difference
to <i>me</i>,' said Pettingill. 'I know what <i>I</i> think of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
her. It's no use talking to the Snow's; <i>they</i> won't
believe anything against her.'</p>

<p>"'That's very true,' said Mrs. Snow, who had
entered unperceived, and heard a great part of
their conversation. 'Mrs. Clark has been with us
six months, and is blameless and correct in her
deportment. She has been shamefully ill-treated
and slandered by her husband, as <i>I</i> know, and the
gentleman about whom you were getting up such
a fine story is her <i>brother</i>, who has just returned
from Europe. When he said he 'would protect
her,' he intended to be as good as his word; and
for your own sakes I would advise you to <i>bear it
in mind</i>. I have the pleasure to wish you both
good-morning.'</p>

<p>"'There's a tempest in a thimble,' said Charity,
as she drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"'Ain't it, though!' said Pettingill. 'But I'll
warrant we shall catch her tripping yet. These
'grass widows,' you know.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said Charity&mdash;'and so pretty, too. I
never saw a <i>pretty</i> woman that behaved herself."</p>

HORACE MANN'S "OPINION."</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Horace Mann, in his lecture on "Woman,"
says: "I see but one reason why woman
should not preach the gospel, and that reason is,
that it is ten thousand times better to go about
<i>practising</i> the gospel, than even to preach it."</p>

<p>"On this hint," Fanny characteristically waxes
eloquent.</p>

<p class="p2">
"I'm perfectly ready to close my female eyes
now! Here's justice meted out to our suffering
sex at last, and by a <i>Man-n</i>, too! Nobody can
disturb the serenity of my soul to-day. I feel like
a crowned martyr; could shake hands with every
enemy I have except &mdash;&mdash;! Anybody any 'little
favors' to ask, now is their time! If my bonnet
wasn't bran new, I'd toss it up till it got hitched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
on the horn of <i>some</i> celestial dilemma. Wonder
if all those democrat cannons are used up? It's
outrageous there's no way provided for a woman
to express her surplus enthusiasm. If I roll up
my eyes, it may suggest a pitcher of water in my
face; hysterics would but feebly express my emotions;
(besides, I don't know how they are got up)
no use in fainting unless there's somebody 'worth
while' at hand to bring you to. What's to be
done? I'll borrow a 'True Flag,' and hoist it.
I'll go into the woods and shout huzza! Never
mind whether he's married or single&mdash;he's too
much of a curiosity for a <i>monopoly</i>. Barnum must
have him; he belongs to the world in general.
He's booked for immortality! Napoleon, and
Hannibal, and Cæsar weren't a circumstance!
Just think of Horace Mann's <i>moral courage</i> in propagating
such an unpopular sentiment! I shall
have to get out a Fern dictionary. Can't find
words to express my tumultuous emotions!"

WHAT FANNY THINKS OF HOT
WEATHER.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Shadrach, Meshek, and Molock! how hot it
is! I pity omnibus horses and ministers; I
pity the little victims of narrow benches and short
recesses; I pity ignorant young mothers with
teething babies; I pity the Irish who huddle in a
cellar and take boarders in each corner; I pity
consumptive semptresses who "sing the song of
the shirt" for six cents per day; I pity dandies
with tight boots; I pity cooks and blacksmiths,
and red-haired people; I pity anybody who
doesn't live in a refrigerator, and hasn't a <i>Fan</i> to
<i>temper</i> the air.</p>

FAMILY JARS.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
This is a subject on which Fanny <i>ought</i> to speak
<i>feelingly</i>. Her article thus entitled, is, however,
full of funny hits, doubtless much like the roses
which crown the skeleton, or the smiles which
hide the heart-ache. Poor Fanny!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Domestie peace can never be <i>preserved</i> in family jars."</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Jeremiah Stubbs was rash enough to remark,
one morning, to his wife Keziah, "that, after all,
women had little or nothing to do; that he only
wished she knew the responsibilities of a man of
business." (Jeremiah kept a small shop, well
stocked with maple sugar, suspicious looking
doughnuts, ancient pies and decayed lemons.)&mdash;"Yes,
Keziah, if you only knew the responsibilities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
of a <i>man of business</i>,' said Jeremiah, fishing up
the corner of his dickey from a questionable looking
red neckerchief that protected his jugular.</p>

<p>"'Well, let me know 'em, then,' said his wife,
tying on her bonnet. 'Seeing is believing. We
will change works for one day. You get breakfast,
tend the baby, and wash and dress the other
three children, and I'll go down and open shop.'</p>

<p>"Jeremiah didn't exactly look for this termination
to the discussion; but he was a man, and of
course never backed out; so he took a survey of
the premises, wondering which end to begin,
while Keziah went on her way rejoicing, took
down the shutters like a master-workman, opened
shop, made a fire, arranged the tempting wares
above mentioned, with feminine ingenuity; putting
the best side of everything uppermost, and
wishing she had nothing else to do, from day to
day, but stand behind the counter and sell them.</p>

<p>"This accomplished, she went home to breakfast.
There sat Jeremiah, in a chair, in the middle of
the room, with one side of his beard shaved off,
and the lather drying on the remainder, trotting a
little blue-looking wretch, in a yellow flannel
night-gown, who was rubbing some soft gingerbread
into his bosom with his little fists, by way
of amusement. The coffee had boiled over into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the ashes, and Thomas Jefferson and Napoleon
Buonaparte Stubbs were stirring up the miniature
pond with Jeremiah's razor. James Madison was
still between the sheets, vociferating loudly for
'his breakfast.'</p>

<p>"Looking with a curious eye over the pile of
scorched toast for a piece that was eatable, Keziah
commenced her breakfast, referring her interesting
young family to their paternal derivative for a
supply of their numerous wants. At last he
placed a cup of muddy coffee before him, congratulating
himself that his labors were ended,
when the baby, considering it an invasion of his
rights, made a dive at it, and he sprang from his
chair with the scalding contents dripping from
his unwhisperables, and&mdash;a word that church-members
don't use&mdash;hissing from between his
teeth.</p>

<p>"Calm as a summer morning, Keziah replaced
her time-worn straw upon her head, telling Jerry
that her children must be prepared for school at
nine o'clock, the room must be swept and righted,
the breakfast things washed, the potatoes boiled,
and the mince-meat prepared for dinner by twelve.
Her husband grinned a ghastly smile, and told
her 'that was easy done.' No such thing. The
comb couldn't be found; he had to wipe James
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Madison's presidential phiz-mahogany on the corner
of the table-cloth. Napoleon Buonaparte's
pinafore had been used to wipe the dishes; Thomas
Jefferson had rejoiced twice in a pair of boxed
ears, for devouring the contents of the sugar-bowl;
and that little yellow flannel night-gown
was clutching at his heels, every step he took over
the floor.</p>

<p>"Miserable Jeremiah! didn't you wish you were
a woman? Well, 'time and tide wait for no
man.' Twelve o'clock came, and so did Keziah.
Her husband would rather have seen the &mdash;&mdash;
hem! The bed was unmade, the children's hair
stood up 'seven ways of a Sunday,' the cat was
devouring the meat, the baby had the chopping-knife,
and Napoleon Buonaparte was playing ball
with the potatoes.</p>

<p>"Jeremiah's desire for immediate emancipation
overcame his pride, and passing his arms <i>half-way</i>
around Keziah's waist, (it was so large that he
always made a chalk mark where he left off embracing,
that he might know where to begin
again,) he told her she was an angel, and he was a
poor miserable wretch, and was ready to acknowledge
his mistake. Keziah very quietly withdrew
from his arm, told him the bargain was made for
the day, and she would change works at night;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
and treating herself to a piece of bread and butter,
she departed. Jerry sat for a minute looking into
the fire, then reaching down a huge parcel of
maple-sugar, he put it on the floor, and seating all
the young hopefuls round it, turned the key on
them and the scene of his cares, mounted his
beaver on his aching head, and rushed to &mdash;&mdash;'s
for a <i>whiskey punch</i>! The room was nice and
tidy, the fire was comfortable, the punch was
<i>strong</i>, and Jeremiah was <i>weak</i>. He woke <i>about
dark</i>, from troubled dreams of broomsticks and
curtain lectures, and not having sufficient courage
to encounter their fulfilment, has left Keziah
to the glorious independence of a '<i>California
widow</i>.'"</p>

TWO IN HEAVEN.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
The following sketch has been pronounced by a
talented Boston editor, to be the finest and sweetest
article Fanny Fern ever penned. The very
thought might well have served as inspiration.
What roof-tree where the tears have not fallen?
What household that counts not part of its number
by tomb-stones?</p>

<p class="p2">
"<span class="smcap">Two in heaven.</span>&mdash;'You have two children,'
said I.</p>

<p>"'I have four,' was the reply; 'two on earth,
two in heaven.'</p>

<p>"There spoke the mother! Still hers! only
'gone before!' Still remembered, loved and cherished,
by the hearth and at the board; their places
not yet filled; even though their successors draw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
life from the same faithful breast where <i>their</i> dying
heads were pillowed.</p>

<p>"'Two in heaven!'</p>

<p>"Safely housed from storm and tempest; no sickness
there; nor drooping head, nor fading eye, nor
weary feet. By the green pastures; tended by the
Good Shepherd, linger the little lambs of the heavenly
fold.</p>

<p>"'Two in heaven!'</p>

<p>"Earth less attractive! Eternity nearer! Invisible
cords, drawing the maternal soul upwards.
'Still small' voices, ever whispering <i>come</i>! to the
world-weary spirit.</p>

<p>"'Two in heaven!'</p>

<p>"Mother of angels! Walk softly! holy eyes
watch thy footsteps! cherub forms bend to listen!
Keep thy spirit free from earth-taint; so shalt
thou 'go to them,' though they may not 'return to
thee.'"

THE PRIVATE HISTORY OF DIDYMUS
DAISY, ESQ.&mdash;<br />BY FANNY FERN.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Mrs. Daisy styled herself a <i>pattern wife</i>; a
bright and shining light in the matrimonial
firmament. She had inscribed on her girdle these
words, from John Milton, or Mother Goose, I forget
which: '<i>He</i> for God only, <i>she</i> for God in <i>him</i>.'</p>

<p>"She never laced her boots without asking her
husband's advice, and the length of her boddice,
or the depth of her flounces, were dependent upon
his final decision. She went into strong convulsions
at sight of a 'Bloomer,' and rolled up the
whites of her eyes, like a duck in a thunderstorm,
at the mention of the 'Woman's Rights' Convention,'
and considered any woman who persisted in
loving <i>white</i> bread, when her husband ate <i>brown</i>,
as only fit for the place where&mdash;&mdash;air-tight stoves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
and furnaces are unnecessary! Her voice was soft
and oily; she never spoke above her breath, and
her motions were slow, funereal and perpendicular.</p>

<p>"And now I suppose you imagine Didymus was
master of his own house! <i>Deuce a bit of it!</i>
There was a look in the corner of his wife's eye
that was as good as a loaded musket, and he
fetched and carried accordingly, like a trained
spaniel, tiptoeing through life on a chalk-mark,
and <i>precious careful</i> at <i>that</i>; confining his observation
of the world to the latitude and longitude
of her apron-strings. But it was always 'husband,'
and 'dear Daisy,' even when he knew his
life wasn't worth two cents if he abated one jot or
tittle of his matrimonial loyalty.</p>

<p>"It was very refreshing to hear her ask him 'his
opinion' in company, and his diplomatic windings
and twistings on those occasions were worthy of
the wiliest politician that ever flourished at the
'White House.' As to speaking to any other
female than Mrs. Daisy, he would as soon have
ordered his own coffin; and, truth to tell, this was
where the matrimonial yoke weighed the heaviest,
for Didymus (unlucky wretch) had an eye for a
dainty waist or a pair of falling shoulders, or a
light, springing step; but the way he had to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
'<i>shoulder!</i> <i>march!</i>' when they 'hove in sight,'
was crucifying to his feelings!</p>

<p>"Mrs. Daisy always went with him, to and from
the store, for '<i>exercise</i>.'(?) He was never allowed
to go out after dark; his evenings being mainly
occupied in holding skeins of silk, or sorting knots
of 'German Worsted,' to give his wife an opportunity
to immortalize her genius in transforming the
same into hump-backed dogs, deformed lambs and
rabbits, with ears twice as long as their bodies.
Under such watchful guardianship he was in a fair
way to be able to omit entirely at his orisons, this
petition&mdash;'Lead us not into temptation.'</p>

<p>"This hymeneal strait-jacket was more particularly
affecting, inasmuch as Mrs. Daisy <i>herself</i> was
not what her <i>name</i> would seem to suggest, saving
that she was very red. It was the problem of her
life to find dresses and hats that 'agreed with her
complexion,' and she might well have exclaimed
'how <i>expensive it is to be ugly</i>.'</p>

<p>"Well, 'it's a long lane that has no turning;'
and so Didymus thought, when he woke up one
fine morning and found himself a widower! Did
you ever see a poor robin let loose from a cage?
or a mouse released from the clutches of grimalkin?
or a kitten emancipated from an easy-chair,
where she had been mistaken for a cushion by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
some fat old lady of about two hundred weight?
Well&mdash;<i>I say nothing</i>! The satisfaction with which
Didymus ordered his 'weeds,' spoke for itself! In
<span class="smcap">HIS</span> mental rainbow, <i>black</i> was hereafter to be
'<i>couleur de rose</i>!' He purchased Mrs. Daisy a <i>nice</i>
coffin, and a <span class="smcap">STRONG</span> one; and his speech to Miss
Maria Fitz Bumble was cut and dried, and ready
for delivery as soon as he had safely planted his
<i>first</i> Daisy in the earth!</p>

<p>"Didymus was a <i>man</i> again! He dared to look
himself in the face! He stood up straight, and,
clapping his hand on his waistband, exclaimed&mdash;'Daisy,
<i>this</i> is living, old boy!' Julius Cæsar!
what ails the man, as he turns his horrified gaze
towards the bed!</p>

<p>"'There&mdash;there! <i>that'll do!</i>' said Mrs. Daisy.
'Don't make a donkey of yourself, Didymus, because
<i>that</i> is unnecessary! I was only in a <i>faint</i>,
my dear! A <span class="smcap">FEINT</span>&mdash;ha! ha! I think I understand
you <i>now</i>, from Genesis to Revelations. That
<i>black</i> coat's a <i>good fit</i>;&mdash;very <i>becoming</i>, too! <i>Maria</i>&mdash;<i>Fitz</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">B-u-m-b-l-e-e</span>!!
There, that'll <span class="smcap">DO</span>, Didymus.
<i>Sorry to disappoint you</i>, but I'm just as good
as <i>new</i>!'"</p>

THE WEDDING DRESS.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Under this title appeared in the columns of the
True Flag, one of Fanny's most effective
sketches. Thus ran the tale:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"'Good-bye, dearest mother,' said Emma, as she
pressed her lips to her forehead. 'Let me bring
your foot-stool and your spectacles before I go.
We shall have a lovely drive, and I'll not stay
after nightfall.'</p>

<p>"As she listened to the sound of the retreating
wheels, Mrs. Leland said to herself, 'I'm selfish
to be unwilling to part with Emma, but she is so
good and so beautiful. Her presence is like a ray
of sunshine; my room seems so dark and cheerless
when she leaves me; and yet it will not be
long that I can watch over her; and when these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
dim eyes are closing, it will be a comfort to know
that she has a protector and a husband.'</p>

<p>"Mrs. Leland was a widow&mdash;that name always
suggestive of desolation, want and sorrow. Her
husband, however, had left herself and Emma
enough to keep them from suffering, and the latter
had made her musical talents available in driving
poverty from the door.</p>

<p>"About a year before the date of my story,
Emma had met with Lionel. Of prepossessing exterior
and polished manners, the young merchant
had made himself a welcome guest at the quiet
fireside of the widow. Thoughtful and attentive
to Mrs. Leland, he had already yielded her the devotion
of a son. She was alone most of the day,
but when Emma returned to her at night, with
her tasks completed, and they were seated around
their little table, and Emma herself prepared the
nice cup of tea that was to refresh her invalid
mother, and evening came, and with it Lionel,
with his bright, handsome face, and winning smile
and soft low tones; how quickly the hours fled
away! And now she was soon to be his bride.
Their cottage home in the outskirts of the city
was already chosen, and thither they had gone to
make arrangements for their removal. And who
so happy as the lovers, that long, bright, summer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
afternoon? The little cottage rooms were carefully
inspected; the pretty rosebush was trained
anew over the low door-way, and the gardener
had especial orders to take care of the nice flowerbeds
and gravel walks. Amid the last sweet carol
of the birds, when the flowers, heavy with the
falling dew, were drowsily nodding their heads,
and the first bright star of evening was timidly
stealing forth; in the dim, fragrant twilight, again
and again they exchanged new vows of love.</p>

<p>"When Emma remembered the dull and cheerless
past, life seemed now to her a fairy dream;
she trembled to <i>be</i> so happy. Then a dark shadow
would pass before her eyes, and she would say,
shudderingly, '<i>What if a change should come!</i>' but
she looked in Lionel's face, and remembered it no
more.</p>

<p>"Home was gained at last, Lionel assisted his
fair companion to alight; she sprang gaily up the
steps, and was turning to wave her hand to him
as he left, when she saw a man step up to him,
lay his hand familiarly on his shoulder, and, taking
the reins in <i>his own hands</i>, drive off. Supposing
him to be some friend, or business acquaintance,
she thought no more of it, and passed into the
house.</p>

<p>"'It is needless to ask you if you have enjoyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
your ride, my daughter,' said Mrs. Leland, looking
with a mother's admiration at the bright flush on
her cheek, and her sparkling eye.</p>

<p>"'Oh! it was so delightful, mother, at the cottage;
and we shall be so <i>happy</i> there,' said the
fair girl, as she laid aside her pretty hat and shook
from their confinement her long, bright tresses.
Then, seating herself at the window, she commenced
embroidering a part of her wedding dress.</p>

<p>"Soon after, a stranger called to see Mrs. Leland
on business; and Emma withdrew to their little
bed-room. She was sitting there, busy with her
work; a song, sweet as a bird's carol trembled on
her lips, when Mrs. Leland returned.</p>

<p>"'Emma!'</p>

<p>"She turned her head to see her mother's face
overspread with the pallor of death. Springing
to her side, she said, 'Mother! dear mother! who
has dared? what has troubled you? who is this
stranger?'</p>

<p>"Her mother pointed to the wedding dress,
saying, (as if every word rent her heart-strings,)</p>

<p>"'Emma, <i>you'll never need that</i>! Lionel is
arrested for forgery.'</p>

<p>"''Tis false!' Emma would have said, but the
words died on her lips, and she fell heavily to the
floor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"One fainting fit succeeded another through
that long, dreary night, till life seemed almost suspended.
Morning came, and woke the sufferer to
consciousness. Passing her hand slowly across
her forehead, as if still bewildered, and unable to
realize the dreadful change that had passed over
her, she said,</p>

<p>"'Mother, I must go to Lionel!'</p>

<p>"'No, no,' said Mrs. Leland, ''tis no place for
you, Emma.'</p>

<p>"Covering her face, as if to shut out some
dreadful vision, she said, 'I care not <i>where</i> I find
him, mother! I must go or <i>die</i>. Would you kill
your child?'</p>

<p>"The succeeding day found her at the prison
door. As the key grated in the lock for her admittance,
she shuddered and hung back; but it
was only for an instant. Nerving herself, as by a
strong effort, she advanced and threw herself,
fainting, upon Lionel's breast. As the jailer came
towards her, Lionel started to his feet, and with a
fierce gesture, motioned him off. Pressing his lips
to her cold forehead, he said to himself, 'If she
would but pass away thus!' But death comes
not at the bidding of the wretched, and there she
lay, that young, fair thing, with her beautiful head
bowed with grief and shame; still loving, still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
trusting, through dishonor and pain, with the
strong, deep love of <i>a woman's heart</i>. Even the
stern jailer, though inured to scenes of human suffering,
brushed away the tears with his rough hand
from his furrowed cheeks, and said, 'God be merciful.'</p>

<p>"Few words were spoken by either, and the
allotted hour passed by. One long embrace&mdash;and
the wretched man was again <i>alone</i> in his cell, with
an accusing conscience; the darker, the gloomier
for the angel-light that was withdrawn.</p>

<p>"And Emma! She was borne back again to
the arms that had pillowed her infancy, and laid
her head upon her mother's breast like a tired
child. The agony of that hour had done the work
of years. The rose had faded from the cheek, the
eyes were dim and lustreless. She only said, '<i>I'm
weary</i>.'</p>

<p>"And so weeks passed by. Nothing interested
her, nothing seemed to rouse her from her apathy.
At length news reached them of Lionel's escape!
The change in Emma was instantaneous. Her
manner became excited, nervous and hurried; she
passed about the house arranging everything to
the best advantage, as if expecting some friend or
guest.</p>

<p>"One stormy night they sat at their little table,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
each busy with their own sad memories. The
wind wailed dismally, and the beating rain had
driven every living thing to seek a shelter. Mrs.
Leland spoke of the fury of the storm, and Emma
glanced toward the window. A dark face was
prest close against it! Those eyes! (she passed
her hand across her own, as if to clear her vision,)
those eyes were Lionel's! Tottering as if bent by
age, she staggered towards the door, and in a moment
they were in each other's arms. What a
night of fear, and horror, and joy was that! for
he must away before the day should dawn.</p>

<p>"'Then you go not <i>alone</i>,' said Emma; 'if you
have sinned you have also <i>suffered</i>.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, and it's but right he should,' said a
rough voice, as the door was rudely burst, and a
stout man advanced to make him prisoner.</p>

<p>"Lionel had prepared himself for <i>this</i>. A flash!
a report! the lovers lay side by side. They were
<i>both prisoners</i>, but <i>Death</i> was the <i>jailer</i>!"

IS IT BEST TO USE ENVELOPES?</h2>

<p>On this question hear Fanny!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">
"Mrs. Joseph Smith was the envy of all the
wives in the neighborhood. Such a <i>pattern</i> husband
as Smith was, to be sure! He never went
across the room without hugging his wife first,
and language would fail to describe their melancholy
partings when he 'tore himself away,' to
go down to the store. If the wind got round
east after he had left, he always ran back to tell
her to put on an extra petticoat; he cut up her
food in hom&oelig;opathic infinitessimal bits, to assist
her digestion, and if she wanted an ice-cream or a
lobster-salad in the middle of the night, it was
forthcoming. Did she have the headache, the
blinds were closed, the bell was muffled, and he
was the most wretched of Smiths till she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
convalescent. He selected her shoe-strings and
corset-lacings himself, and when her health was
too delicate to admit of her accompanying him
to church, he always promised to sit in the middle
of the house, so that in case the galleries
should fall he needn't be made any <i>flatter</i> than
he was by nature.</p>

<p>"The present Mrs. Smith was his <i>fourth</i> wife,
and as Joseph had been heard to say, that 'the
more he loved his Elenore, the more he loved
his Nancy, and the more he loved his Nancy, the
more he loved his Julia and Mary,' any one
with half an eye, could see how peculiarly felicitious
<i>Mrs. Mary Smith's</i> position must be!</p>

<p>"There never was a sweet without a bitter;
and so she found out, when Joseph announced
to her that he 'must leave the little heaven of
her smiles, to go on a short 'business trip.' Mary
went into the strongest kind of hysterics, and
burnt feathers and sal-volatile couldn't bring her
out of them, till he swore on the dictionary to
telegraph to her every hour, and carry his life
preserver and a box of Russia salve.</p>

<p>"On arriving at the depot, a gentleman requested
leave 'to place a lady under his protection,'
who was travelling in the same direction.
Smith looked at her; she was young and pretty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
and dressed in deep mourning. 'A widow!'
said Smith to himself. 'Certainly, sir, with
pleasure.'</p>

<p>"How they <i>did</i> get on! With opening and
shutting the windows in the cars, pulling that
travelling shawl round the pretty shoulders that
<i>wouldn't</i> keep it up, and trying to quiet her nerves
when the cars went through 'the dark places,'
Smith didn't know any more than <i>you</i> whether
they were travelling through France or Spain, and
what's more, he <i>didn't care</i>!</p>

<p>"Arriving at their place of destination much
sooner than was necessary, (conductors and engineers
have no bowels of mercy,) he escorted
the widow to the house of her friend, taking the
most disinterested care of the big and little bandboxes,
and was strongly tempted to put an end to
the life of the little poodle-dog she carried in her
arms.</p>

<p>"An hour after, he sat down in his lonely
quarters at the hotel, and dutifully drew towards
him a sheet of paper to write to his wife. It ran
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"'<span class="smcap">My Dearest Wife</span>: If you knew how utterly
desolate I am without you. I can think of
nothing else, and feel entirely unfitted for business.
As for <i>pleasure</i>, that is out of the question, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
you. I've been bored to death with the care of
an empty-headed woman&mdash;(you know I couldn't
<i>refuse</i>, my angel); but I never will be hampered so
again. I long for the day that will return me to
your arms. Your loving husband,</p>

<p class="left65">
"'J. S&mdash;&mdash;.'</p>

<p class="p2">"Then drawing towards him a nice sheet of embossed
note-paper, he penned the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"'<span class="smcap">My Dear Madam</span>: Those blue eyes have
never ceased to haunt me since we parted. Thank
you for your flattering acceptance of my invitation
to ride. I will call for you at four this afternoon.
Till then, my heart is with you.</p>

<p class="left45">
"'Yours, ever,</p>

<p class="left65">"'<span class="smcap">Joseph Smith</span>.'</p>

<p class="p2">"Full two mortal hours Joseph spent at his
'twilight,' adorning his outer man. How those
whiskers were curled and perfumed! What a fit
were those primrose kid gloves! How immaculate
was that shirt bosom! How <i>excruciatingly</i>
those boots pinched! The very horses pricked up
their ears and arched their necks proudly, as if
they knew what a freight of loveliness they were
to carry.</p>

<p>"Arrived at the widow's Joseph handed the
reins to a servant and was settling his pet curl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
preparatory to mounting the stairs, when a letter
was rudely thrust into his hand, and he was unceremoniously
seized by <i>that</i> dickey and sent spinning
out upon the side-walk. As soon as he recovered
breath, he picked himself up, and looked
at the letter. Horror of horrors! He had placed
the letters in the wrong envelopes! The widow
had his wife's, and what was worse, his wife the
widow's! Oh, Smith! Oh, <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> Smith!</p>

<p class="p2">"<span class="smcap">Moral.</span>&mdash;Some think it wise to use envelopes,
'some <i>othewise</i>.' <i>Joseph</i> inclines to the <i>latter</i> opinion,
and advises all 'pattern husbands' to be of
the same mind. His message hails from California!"

FEMININE WISDOM.</h2>

We insert the following for the special benefit

much as <i>she</i> does,' but then that is hardly to be
expected.</p>

<p class="p2">
"Tupper, speaking of the choice of a wife, says,
'Hath she wisdom? it is precious, but <i>beware that
thou exceed</i>!'</p>

<p>"My dear sir, wasn't you caught napping that
time? Didn't you speak in meeting? Didn't
cloven feet peep out of your literary shoes? Don't
it take an American woman to see through you!
Isn't that a tacit acknowledgment that there <i>are</i>
women who do 'exceed?' Wouldn't you think
so if you lived <i>this</i> side the pond? Hope you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
don't judge <i>us</i> by John Bull's daughters, who
stupefy themselves on roast-beef and porter. I tell
you Yankee women are on the squirrel order.
You'd lose your English breath trying to follow
them. There isn't a man here in America that
knows as much as his wife. Some of them <i>own</i> it,
and some don't, but they all believe it, like gospel.
They ask our opinion about everything. Sometimes
straightforward, and sometimes in a circle&mdash;but
they <i>ask it</i>! There are petticoats in the
pulpit, petticoats in the editorial chair, petticoats
in the lecturer's desk, petticoats behind the
counter, petticoats labelled 'M. D.' Oh, <i>they
'exceed</i>!' no mistake about that. All femality is
wide awake over here, Mr. Tupper. They crowd,
and jostle, and push, just as if they wore hats. I
don't uphold them in <i>that</i>, because, as I tell them,
'tis better policy to play possum, and wear the
mask of submission. No use in rousing any
<i>unnecessary</i> antagonism. <i>But they don't all know as
much as I do.</i> I shall reach the goal just as quick
in my velvet shoes, as if I tramped on rough-shod
as they do, with their <i>Woman's Rights Convention
brogans</i>!"

ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Why, Fanny Fern! Did you ever hear any old
saying about practising and preaching? How
came you ever to think of this sentiment? Oh,
Fanny! you are a born <i>writer of fiction</i>. Didn't
you prove your genius for that sort of thing when
you wrote the following 'Fern.'</p>

<p class="p2">
"Well, now, do you know I did that, till I came
very near being mobbed in the street for a curiosity?
I was verdant enough to believe that 'honesty
was the best policy.' The first astonisher
that I had, was on the occasion of the visit of a
vain old lady to our house, before I was out of
pantalettes. Her bonnet was stuck full of artificial
flowers, looking as much out of place as a wreath
of rosebuds on a mummy! Some such thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
was passing through my mind, as I stood looking
at her&mdash;when, mistaking my protracted gaze for
one of <i>admiration</i>, she faced square about, and
asked me if I didn't think they were <i>becoming</i>?
'<i>No ma'am</i>,' said I, never flinching a hair. <i>Didn't</i>
I get a boxed ear for that?</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't make out much better in my
subsequent attempts to 'speak the truth;' and
what visionary ever concocted such nonsense, <i>I'm</i>
at a loss to know.</p>

<p>"I'd like to put the question to you, and <i>you</i>,
and <span class="smcap">YOU</span>, and YOU!&mdash;Would the wheels of creation
ever 'go ahead' without one everlasting intolerable
squeak, if they were not 'oiled up' constantly
with flattery? No shirking, now! no
dodging the question! <span class="smcap">Of course</span> they wouldn't!
I humbly confess I ain't broke in myself, as much
as I ought to be, but I'm learning by degrees! I
can't help looking over my shoulder occasionally
when anybody says a pretty thing to me to see if
'cloven foot' is anywhere round! but that will
wear off in time. It almost killed me the first
time I did the agreeable to a person I had no more
respect for than Judas Iscariot, but I lived through
it, though I don't take to it naturally!</p>

<p>"I've a tell-tale trick of blushing, too, when I'm
being delivered of a lie, that stands very much in

my light. I'm afraid there's some defect in my organization.
I've applied to two or three young

I'm thinking of putting myself under the tuition
of &mdash;&mdash;; if I don't 'take my degree' <span class="smcap">THEN</span>, I'll

<p>"Oh dear! it's an awful thing to grow up! to find
your catechise, and Jack the Giant-Killer, and your
Primer, and Mother Goose, all a humbug! To
come across a wolf making 'sheep's eyes' at a

saints to know them from the sinners; to see husbands,

MOSES MILTIADES MADISON.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Everybody knows Moses. He and others
like him, "carry the bag" in too many of our
churches. But nobody seems to know him so well
as Fanny; so we will let her relate his "experience,"
in her own words:</p>

<p class="p2">
"Moses Miltiades Madison would fain have the
world believe that the stumbling-block the fallen
angels tripped over was no besetting sin of <i>his</i>.</p>

<p>"The very tails of his coat hung around him in a
helpless kind of a way, as if they knew they <i>ought</i>
to be suggestive of their owner's <i>humility</i>. No sinful
zephyrs presumed to dally with the straight
locks, plastered with such puritanical precision over
his diminutive head; his mouth had a sanctimonious
drawing down at the corners, and his voice
was a cross between a groan and a wail. At every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
prayer-meeting and conventicle, Moses was on the
ground, (simultaneously with the sexton,) made the
most long-winded prayer; elaborated to <i>seventh</i>-<span class="smcap">LIE</span>,
the verse he was expounding, and kept one note
ahead of the singing-choir in the 'doxology;'
knew exactly how long it would be before the natives
of the Palm Tree Islands would dress more
fashionably than the wild beasts around them, and
was entirely posted up about the last speech and
confession of the very latest missionary whom the
savages had made mince-meat of.</p>

<p>"Now Moses had an invalid wife; and his 'path
of duty,' after evening meeting, generally laid in
the direction of Widow Gray's house. <i>She</i> was
'<i>afraid</i>' and <i>he&mdash;wasn't</i>! So he took the prayer-book,
the Bible, and the widow, under his protection,
and went the longest way round. His wife,
to be sure, before his return, came to the conclusion
that it was a '<i>protracted</i> meeting,' but then <i>Moses</i>
was 'a burning and a shining light,' (at least so
the 'church' said,) and if <i>Mrs.</i> Moses was of a different
opinion, she kept it to herself. That he did
occasionally pervert Scripture words and phrases,
and make a very 'carnal' use of the same, when
none of the congregation were present, was an indisputable
fact; that the crickets, and chairs and
tables, sometimes changed places in a hurry, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
another; but the last was probably owing to his
being a 'medium' for some '<i>spiritual</i> rappings.'</p>

<p>"But if Mrs. Moses 'kept dark,' Jeremiah Jones
wouldn't! He was as thorough and straight-forward
in his religion as he was in building houses;
he detested 'sham foundations,' as he professionally
expressed it!</p>

<p>"One night, in an evil hour, Moses popped up,
as usual, from his seat in meeting, intending to
give an extra touch to his devotional exercises, as
he contemplated taking a longer walk than usual
with little Widow Gray. So he told 'the brethren,'
(through his nose,) that 'if ever there <i>was</i> a sinner
that deserved a <i>very</i> uncomfortable place hereafter,
it was <i>him</i>&mdash;(<i>Moses!</i>)&mdash;that it was a marvel to him
that he was permitted to cumber the earth, that
his sins were more than the hairs on his head,'
(and, by the way, that was a very moderate computation!)</p>

<p>"So Jeremiah Jones seemed to think; for he
'riz' very demurely, and remarked that 'he had
been brother Moses Madison's neighbor for many
years, and was qualified to endorse that little statement
of his, with regard to himself, as <i>substantially
correct in every particular</i>!' Moses fainted!"

TOM VERSUS FAN; OR, A LITTLE TALK
ABOUT LITTLE THINGS.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
In the sketch thus entitled, we are once more
presented with a life picture, a veritable transcript
of the writer's own mind. It will be seen
that Fanny is <i>au fait</i> in the mysteries of coquetry;
understands the use of long dresses, and "gaiter-boots"
to perfection. Just listen:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"'Well, Fan; any room for <i>me</i> here?' said Tom
Grey, as he seated himself in a large arm-chair in
his sister's boudoir.</p>

<p>"'Possession is nine points of the law, Tom; it's
no use answering in the negative <i>now</i>.'</p>

<p>"'I'm in a very distracted state of mind, sis, and
I've come to make a clean breast of it to you.'</p>

<p>"'Mercy on us! if you are going to confess your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
sins, I shall beat a retreat; the catalogue is longer
than my patience.'</p>

<p>"'Listen; you know yesterday was one of my
days for walking?'</p>

<p>"'Boisterous wind, hey?'</p>

<p>"'Yes; and a man <i>must</i> use his eyes when the
gods favor him. Just before me, in Washington-street,
I saw <i>such</i> a pair of feet! Now you know
pretty feet are my passion, and 'Cinderella's' were
not a circumstance to these. So I travelled on behind
them, in a state of mute ecstacy, and they
might have led me to the Dead Sea, and I shouldn't
have stopped to ask any questions!'</p>

<p>"'Did you see her face?'</p>

<p>"'<i>Face?</i>&mdash;I didn't think of such a thing. <i>I</i>
shouldn't have cared if she hadn't any face. Of
course it was pretty; nature wouldn't have perfected
those continuations to that degree and left&mdash;but
no matter, they were 'the <i>greatest</i>' feet for
<i>little feet</i>, I ever saw. All of a sudden my goddess
vanished into a shoe-store, and I stood gaping in
at the window and wishing I was the clerk. Presently,
the young man handed her a pair of boots,
and going round the counter, down he goes on one
knee, and, by the blessed saints! if <i>he didn't take
that dear little foot in his lap and try on those boots</i>!
The rascal was twice as long about it as he need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
be, too, for after it was all laced on, he kept 'smoothing
out the wrinkles,' as <i>he</i> said, 'on the instep.'
St. Crispin! <i>wasn't</i> I furious!'</p>

<p>"'Well&mdash;didn't you see her face, all this time?'</p>

<p>"'No, I tell you; she had one of those curs&mdash;I
beg pardon&mdash;<i>curious</i> veils that you women are so
fond of playing <i>beau peep</i> with! But her shawl fell
off, and you'd better believe there was a figure
under it even <i>those feet</i> might be proud to carry.'</p>

<p>"'Well&mdash;let's have the denouement.'</p>

<p>"'She got into an omnibus&mdash;didn't I wish I was
the mat in the bottom of it? No room for another
soul, outside or in, or I should have followed her.
Wish I might wake up and find myself <i>married to
those feet</i>, some morning!'</p>

<p>"'Fan&mdash;these long skirts are very effective
weapons in the hands of a pretty woman. They
are provocative of curiosity. Now Bloomers&mdash;ugh!
(a man is disenchanted at once;) but a nice,
plump, little, cunning foot, creeping in and out,
<i>mice-like</i>, from under those graceful folds&mdash;depend
upon it, no woman who knows anything, will ever
shorten her skirts. A coquette does as much execution
with them as a Spanish dame with her fan
and mantilla.'</p>

<p>"'Many a woman, when she thinks it worth her
while, 'gets up' an imaginary quagmire, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
presto! <i>there's</i> a pair of feet for you! and then
down goes the long skirt again, and a man's senses
with it. Jupiter! <i>don't</i> they understand it?'</p>

<p>"'Tom, if you was worth the trouble, I'd box
your ears! Look out the window there, I <i>suppose</i>
that's a man; a <i>cane and a coat-tail walking behind a
moustache</i>! Well, here's the thermometer up to
boiling point, and his coat is buttoned up tight to
his jugular, <i>to show his chest</i> to the best possible
advantage. I don't believe if he was stifling,
he'd let his throat out of prison. Oh, <i>vanity!</i> thy
name is <i>man</i>! I sat here at the window, laughing
till I had fits, to see that fellow <i>prink</i>, the other
morning, and make himself beautiful. The <i>attitudes</i>,
he practised! the different styles of <i>hair</i> he
'got <i>up</i>,' and brushed <i>down!</i> the neck-ties he tried
on! the way his <i>bosom-pin</i> wouldn't <i>locate</i> to his
satisfaction! were all excruciating to my risibles.'</p>

<p>"'Well, Fan, you've no mercy, so I might as
well say&mdash;I suppose, as to the comparative vanity
of men and women,&mdash;it's six of one and half-a-dozen
of the other; but to change the subject. Do
you know I was thinking, to-day, that <i>dentistry</i>
might be made a very fascinating occupation if
one could but choose one's customers?'</p>

<p>"'As how?' said Fan.</p>

<p>"'Why <i>I</i> should proceed after <i>this</i> fashion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
When a pretty woman came to me, I should plant
her down in the crucifying chair; open sundry
mysterious-looking drawers, spread out a formidable
array of instruments under her little nose, take
up all the files, and saws, and scrapers, one by one,
and hold them up to the light to see if they were
ready primed. Then I'd step round behind her
chair (getting napkin, basin, and footstool fixed to
my satisfaction.) The effect I calculated on being
produced, the little blue-eyed victim would turn
pale and look deliciously imploring into my face&mdash;then
I'd use a little 'moral suasion,' as the ministers
say&mdash;and quiet her nerves. Then follows
an examination of her mouth, (I should make a
long job of that!) Very likely the light would
not be right, and I should have to move her head
a little nearer to my shoulder, then it is more than
probable her long curls would get twisted round
the buttons of my coat; <i>there'd</i> be a web for two
to unweave! Then we'd commence <i>again</i>; the
file in my hand makes an unlucky move against
some sensitive tooth,&mdash;by that time it is to be
hoped she'd be ready to faint, and need something
held to her lips! Oh, Fan, my mind is in a
state of vibration between <i>dentistry</i> and the <i>shoe
business</i>!'</p>

<p>"'What do you think of the <i>clerical</i> profession?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
said Fan, laughing. '<i>That</i> would give you
an opportunity to ask them plump, without any
circumlocution or <i>circumbendibus</i>, the state of their
hearts? You'd be of the Methodist persuasion,
of course, and patronize 'Love Feasts.'</p>

<p>"'Not a bit of it. If I went into <i>that</i> line of
business, I'd be a Roman Catholic priest, and get
up a confession box, and the first exercise of my
authority after that would be to get <i>you</i> into a
nunnery <i>somewhere</i>. I never saw a 'Fanny' yet
that wasn't as mischievous as Satan.'</p>

<p>"'The <i>name</i> is infectious, my dear; can't you
get it <i>changed</i> for me? Speaking of that, Tom,
you know that 'miserable young man' that talked

THE ORPHAN.&mdash;BY FANNY FERN.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
It was a rough, dark, unsightly-looking, old farm-house.
The doors were off the hinges, panes of
glass were broken in the windows, the grass had
overgrown the little gravel-path, and the pigs and
poultry went in and out the door as if they were
human. Farmer Brady sat sunning his bloated face
on the door-step, stupid from the effects of the last
debauch; his ungainly, idle boys were quarrelling
which should smoke his pipe, and two great romps
of girls, with uncombed locks and tattered clothes,
were swinging on the gate in front of the house.</p>

<p>"Everything <i>within</i> doors was in keeping with
the disorder that reigned without, save a young,
fair girl, who sat at the low window, busily sewing
on a coarse garment. Her features were regular
and delicate, her hands and feet small and beautifully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
formed, and despite her rustic attire, one could
see with a glance that she was a star that had wandered
from its sphere.</p>

<p>"'I say, Lilla,' said one of the hoydens, bounding
into the kitchen and pulling the comb out of
Lilla's head, as she bent over her work, shedding
the long, brown hair around her slight figure till
her white shoulders and arms were completely
veiled; 'I say, make haste about that gown. Ma
said you should finish it by noon, and you don't
sew half fast enough.'</p>

<p>"Lilla's cheeks flushed, and the small hands wandered
through the mass of hair in the vain attempt
to confine it again, as she said, meekly, 'Won't
you come help me, Betsey? my head aches sadly,
to-day.'</p>

<p>"'No, I won't. You think because you are a
lady, that you can live here on us and do nothing
for a living; but you <i>won't</i>, and you are no better
than Peggy and I, with your soft voice, and long
hair and doll face.' So saying, the romp went back
again to her primitive gymnasium, <i>the gate</i>.</p>

<p>"Lilla's tears flowed fast, as her little fingers flew
more nimbly, and by afternoon her task was completed,
and she obtained permission from her jailers
to take a walk. It was a joy to Lilla to be alone
with nature. It was a relief to free herself from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
vulgar sights and sounds, to exchange coarse taunts,
and rude jests, and harsh words, for the song of
birds, the ripple of the brook, and the soft murmur
of the wind as it sighed through the tall tree-tops.</p>

<p>"Poor Lilla! with a soul so tuned to harmony,
to be condemned to perpetual discord! Through
the long, bright, summer days, to drudge at her
ceaseless toil, at the bidding of those harsh voices;
at night, to creep into her little bed, but to recall
tearfully a dim vision of childhood. A gentle,
wasted form; a fair, sweet face, growing paler,
day by day; large, lustrous, loving eyes, that still
followed her by day and night; then, a confused
recollection of a burial&mdash;afterwards a dispute as to
her future home, ending in a long, dismal journey.
Since then, scanty meals, the harsh blow, coarse
clothing, taunting words and bitter servitude; and
then she would sob herself to sleep as she asked,
'Must it <i>always</i> be thus? is there none to care for
me?'</p>

<p>"The golden days of summer faded away; the
leaves put on their dying glory, the soft wind of
the Indian summer lifted gently the brown tresses
from Lilla's sweet face. She still took her accustomed
walks, but it was <i>not alone</i>. A stranger
had taken up his residence at the village inn. He
had met Lilla in her rambles, and his ready ingenuity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
soon devised a self-introduction. He satisfied
himself that she claimed no affinity to the
disorderly inmates of the farm-house; he drew
from her her little history, and knew that she was
an orphan, unprotected in her own sweet innocence,
save by Him who guards us all.</p>

<p>"And so&mdash;the dewy, dim twilight witnessed
their meetings, and the color came to the pale
cheek of Lilla, and her eyes grew wondrously
beautiful, and her step was as light as her heart,
and harsh household words fell to the ground like
arrows short of the mark&mdash;for <i>Lilla was happy</i>.
In the simplicity of her guileless heart, how should
<i>she</i> know that Vincent lived only for the present?
that she was to him but <i>one</i> of <i>many</i> beautiful
visions, admired <i>to-day</i>&mdash;forgotten <i>to-morrow</i>! It
was such a joy to be near him to feel herself
appreciated, to know that she was beloved!</p>

<p>"And so time passed on; but their meetings
had not been unnoticed; rough threats were
uttered to Lilla if they were continued, for she
had made herself too useful to be spared. All
this was communicated to her lover, as they met
again at the old trysting-place, and <i>then</i>, as she
leaned trustingly on his arm, Vincent whispered
in her ear words whose full import she understood
not. Slowly the truth revealed itself! Her slight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
figure grew erect, as she withdrew from his
supporting arm&mdash;her soft eye flashed with indignation,
and the man of the world stood abashed in
the presence of innocence. A moment&mdash;and <i>he
was alone</i>, beneath the holy stars!</p>

<p>"That night, Lilla fled her home; she could
scarce be more desolate or unprotected. The next
day found her, foot-sore and weary, in the heart
of the great city, startled and trembling like the
timid deer fleeing from its pursuers.</p>

<p>"Lilla knew that she was beautiful. She read it
in the lengthened gaze of the passers-by. Friendless,
houseless and beautiful! God help thee,
Lilla!</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>"In a dark, unhealthy garret sat Lilla! Her
face, still lovely, was pale as marble; her fingers
flew with lightning rapidity over the coarse work
that yielded her only a <i>shelter</i>; but there were
angel faces, (unseen by her,) smiling approval, and
she could clasp those small hands when the day's
toil was over, and say '<i>Our Father</i>,' with the
innocent heart of childhood, and invisible ones
had charge to guard her footsteps, and 'He who
feedeth the ravens,' gave her 'daily bread.'</p>

<p>"One day she took her little bundle, as usual,
to the shop of her employers, and, while waiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
for the small pittance due, her eye fell upon an
advertisement 'for a housekeeper,' in a newspaper
before her. But how could <i>she</i> obtain it? without
recommendation, without friends. She resolved to
try. Her little hand trembled nervously as she
pulled the bell of the large, handsome house. She
was preceded by the servant into the library,
where sat a fine-looking man in the prime of life.
He looked admiringly upon the shrinking, modest
face and form before him. She told him, in a few
simple words, her history.</p>

<p>"The eccentric old bachelor paused for a moment,
then taking her hand, he said, 'I advertised
for a <i>housekeeper</i>&mdash;but I'm more in need of a <i>wife</i>.
<i>Will you marry me?</i>'</p>

<p>"And so Lilla became a happy, honored wife;
and if a flush passes over her sweet face when she
meets Vincent in the circle of her husband's acquaintances,
it is from no lingering feeling of affection
for the treacherous heart that held in such,
light estimation the sacred name of <i>orphan</i>."</p>

"'I incline to think that a girl really in love&mdash;one who
bore the evident symptoms of the malady&mdash;would be thought
very improper; yet I have often fancied that there must be
a man born in the world for every woman; one whom to see
would be to love, to reverence, to adore; one with whom her
sympathies would so entirely blend, that she would recognize
him at once her true lord. Now and then these pairs come
together; and woe to her who meets this other self too late.'"<br />
&mdash;<i>Mrs. Crowe.</i></p>

<p>Oh, my dear Mrs. Crowe, don't speak of it!
Isn't it <i>dreadful</i> to think of? It is not only

do anything but think of that '<i>other self</i>.' I've no

your path at every turn and corner. Turn your

like him, the more you mustn't let him see it; but,
my gracious! you <span class="smcap">MUSTN'T</span> like him! of course
you understand <span class="smcap">THAT</span>! Shut your eyes to moonlight
and starlight; peruse Euclid and <i>Walker's

heart soft, reading poetry, or hearing music. <i>Live

Don't you tink it de most happiest?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you 'bout dat ere&mdash;'pends altogether how

</div>

<p>"Sambo! Sambo! be quiet! You needn't
<i>always</i> tell the truth. White folks don't. Just as
sure as you do it, you'll lose every friend you have.</p>

<p>"Don't roll up the whites of your eyes at me
that way. It's gospel I'm telling you. I promise
you I don't go through creation with my eyes shut;
and I've found out that good people always tell
the truth <i>when it don't conflict with their interests</i>;
and they like to hear it from you when it hits none
of their peculiaristicks! There's your chart and
compass, so shape your course accordingly.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't intend to insinuate that matrimony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
isn't paradise! Guess you forget how bewitching
they look when they stand up before the
minister, promising all sorts of pretty things and
afraid to look each other in the eye! Orange
wreaths and bouquet de humbug&mdash;alabaster kid
gloves&mdash;hair curled within an inch of their lives&mdash;Brummel
neck-tie, patent boots, satin slippers and
palpitating hearts! Oh, Sambo! can't make <i>me</i>
believe a cloud ever comes over such a blue sky&mdash;no
indeed! They're just as contented a twelve
month after, as a fly in a spider's web.</p>

<p>"You never saw a husband yet, that wasn't as
docile as a lamb <i>when everything went to his mind</i>.
Don't they always love and cherish their wives as
long as there is a timber left of them? Wouldn't
they extinguish the lamp of life for any man, or
woman, who dare say a word to their dispraise?
Would they ever do that same <i>themselves</i>? Answer
me that?</p>

<p>"And as to wives; they are as easily driven as
a flock of sheep when a locomotive comes tearing
past. <i>Oh!</i> y-e-s, Sambo, matrimony is a 'blessed
institution,' so the ministers say, (finds 'em in <i>fees</i>,
you know!) and so everybody says&mdash;except those
who have <i>tried it</i>? So go away, and don't be <i>wool</i>-gathering.
You'll never be the 'Uncle Tom' of
your tribe."</p>

A WHISPER TO ROMANTIC YOUNG

<p>

love,&mdash;there's happiness for you."</p>
</div>

<p>Girls! <i>that's a humbug!</i> The very <i>thought</i> of
it makes me groan. It's all moonshine. In
fact, men and moonshine in my dictionary are synonymous.</p>

<p>"Water and a crust! <span class="smcap">RATHER</span> spare diet! May
do for the honey-moon. Don't make much difference
<i>then</i>, whether you eat shavings or sardines&mdash;but
when you return to <i>substantials</i>, and your
wedding dress is put away in a trunk for the benefit
of posterity, if you can get your husband to
<i>smile</i> on anything short of a 'sirloin' or a roast
turkey, you are a lucky woman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't every married woman know that a man
is as savage as a New Zealander when he's hungry?
and when he comes home to an empty cupboard
and meets a dozen little piping mouths, (necessary
accompaniments of 'cottages' and 'love,'
clamorous for supper, '<i>Love</i> will have the <i>sulks</i>,'
or my name isn't Fanny. Lovers have a trick of
getting disenchanted, too, when they see their
Aramintas with dresses pinned up round the
waist, hair powdered with sweeping, faces scowled
up over the wash-tub, and soap-suds dripping
from red elbows.</p>

<p>"We know these little accidents never happen
in novels&mdash;where the heroine is always 'dressed
in white, with a rose-bud in her hair,' and lives on
blossoms and May dew! There are no wash-tubs
or gridirons in <i>her</i> cottage; <i>her</i> children are born
cherubim, with a seraphic contempt for dirt pies
and molasses. <i>She</i> remains 'a beauty' to the
end of the chapter, and 'steps out' just in time to
anticipate her first gray hair, her husband drawing
his last breath at the same time, as a dutiful husband
<i>should</i>; and not falling into the unromantic
error of outliving his grief, and marrying a
second time!</p>

<p>"But this humdrum life, girls, is another affair,
with its washing and ironing and cleaning days,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
when children expect boxed ears, and visitors
picked-up dinners. All the 'romance' there is in
it, you can put under a three-cent piece!</p>

<p>"St. Paul says they who marry do well enough,
but they who <i>don't</i> marry do <span class="smcap">WELL-ER</span>! Sensible
man that. Nevertheless, had <i>I</i> flourished in those
times, I would have undertaken to change his sentiments;
for those old-fashioned gentlemen were
worth running after.</p>

<p>"One half the women marry for fear they shall
be old maids. Now I'd like to know why an old
maid is to be snubbed, any more than an old
bachelor? Old bachelors receive 'the mitten,'
occasionally, and old maids have been known to
<i>outlive several 'offers.'</i> They are both useful in
their way&mdash;particularly old bachelors!</p>

<p>"Now <i>I</i> intend to be an old maid; and I shall
found a mutual accommodation society, and admit
old bachelors honorary members. They shall wait
on <i>us</i> evenings, and we'll hem their pocket hand-ker<i>chers</i>
and mend their gloves. No <i>boys under
thirty</i> to be admitted. Irreproachable dickeys,
immaculate shirt-bosoms and faultless boots <i>indispensable</i>.
Gentlemen always to sit on the <i>opposite</i>
side of the room&mdash;no refreshments but <i>ices</i>! <i>Instant
expulsion</i> the consequence of the first attempt
at love-making! No allusion to be made to Moore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
or Byron! The little '<i>bye-laws</i>' of the society
<i>not</i> to be published! Moonlight evenings, the

CLERICAL COURTING.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
The following sketch, published by Mrs. Farrington
under the name of Fanny Fern, is a
graphic life-picture. We are informed that a
worthy gentleman connected with her family by
marriage, sat for the portrait of Ephraim.</p>

<p class="p2">
"Mr. Ephraim Leatherstring labored under the
hallucination that he had a call to preach the
gospel to the heathen. He had hitherto hid his
'light under a bushel' in the worldly occupations
of mending fences, felling trees, driving cattle and
shoeing horses. Conceiving that the chief qualifications
for his new office were <i>a pair of green
spectacles, and a long, petticoat-y, ministerial cloak</i>,
he forthwith equipped himself in this spiritual armor,
and presented himself before 'the <i>Board</i>;' by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
whom, after examination, he was pronounced a
perfect&mdash;<i>shingle!</i> and forthwith set apart for the
work.</p>

<p>"His passage was spoken in the Sea-Gull for
the Ourang Outang Islands, and his sea-chest duly
stored with 'Village Melodies' and penny tracts,
when it was intimated to him by 'the Board' that
it would be advisable for him to provide himself
with a help-meet before starting. Whether they
feared his yoking with an unbeliever, or&mdash;well&mdash;no
matter; any way, two days' grace were allowed
him <i>to find Mrs. Ephraim Leatherstring</i>. Letters of
introduction to three damsels were given him,
whose parents' principles were known to be 'dyed
in the wool.'</p>

<p>"Now this little matrimonial luxury had not
been thought of by Ephraim; or, if it had, was
quickly banished from his mind as a temptation of
Satan, and quite incompatible with his new calling.
However, coming to him recommended by such
high authority, 'Barkis was willing!'</p>

<p>"His first call was upon Miss Charity Church.
She was absent on a visit. Unfortunate female!!
No chance for <i>her</i> to see the Ourang Outang Islands!
Ephraim began to feel nervous, for, now
he had made up his mind to be a victim, he didn't
like to be disappointed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing daunted, he wended his way to Deacon
Pettebone's. His daughter Merinda was as round
as a barrel and much the same shape, as rosy as
an apple and quite as sweet, and had been brought
up by <i>the deacon</i>, and that's <i>enough said</i>! Eph.
made known his errand to the deacon, who was
highly delighted at the honor about to be conferred
on his family, and left him alone with his
chubby daughter, not doubting that she would be
of the same opinion. Now Ephraim, (spite of his
long cloak and green spectacles,) <i>had</i> made the acquaintance
of <i>several other</i> damsels in the course of
his earthly pilgrimage; but he knew that this
missionary wooing was to be got up on a new
principle; so he decorously seated himself in the
farthest corner of the room, placed the palms of
his hands together, allowing the two forefingers to
meet, and began to tell 'his experience,' by way
of solemnizing her mind, to all of which Merinda
appeared to listen with becoming gravity. He
then informed her, that he and 'the Board' had
decided to invite her to be his co-worker and fellow-laborer
in the Ourang Outang vineyard. Then,
peering over his green spectacles at Merinda, who
sat stuffing the corners of her checked apron in
her mouth, he said, '<i>Silence gives consent. Let us
pray.</i>' When he arrived at <i>Amen</i>, and turned his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
head to reward himself with a long look at his
future wife, Merinda was among the missing;
rolling on the grass at the back part of the house,
in a perfect paroxysm of laughter! Eph. had no
more time to waste on such a sinner, so he picked
himself up, and his cloak was soon seen fluttering
in the wind, in the direction of Parson Clutterbuck's.</p>

<p>"Now it was foreordained that Kezia should be
the chosen vessel. She was always at home, and
there he found her; as straight and perpendicular
as if she had swallowed the meeting-house steeple.
His errand was soon made known&mdash;the form
slightly varying from the first order of performances.
Kezia straightened down the folds of her
stiffly-starched neckerchief, and said meekly, that
'she felt inclined to think it was the path of duty
for her;' which Eph. ventured to subscribe to,
with the first holy kiss; when he started back in
consternation, on observing that her red hair was
<i>curled</i> around her face. He shook his head ominously,
and said, 'he was afraid 'the Board' would
think it had a carnal look,'&mdash;but upon Kezia's informing
him that it was a defect she was <i>born with</i>,
they made up their minds that a little patience
and pomatum might, in time, remove this obstacle
to their usefulness, and forthwith embarked on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
sea of matrimony, 'fetching up' at the Ourang
Outang Islands, just in the wane of the honeymoon,
strong in the belief that the fate of heathen
millions, <i>long since unborn</i> (as Mrs. Partington
might say,) lay in their matrimonial hands."

WHAT FOWLER SAYS.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Fowler, the phrenologist, who, probably, never
saw Fanny Fern, sanctions and publishes the
following from one of her friends&mdash;honest John
Walter, we suspect. The reader who has perused
the preceding pages can judge of its truthfulness:</p>

<p class="p2">
"Fanny Fern is the most retiring and unobtrusive
of human beings. More than any other celebrity
we have ever known, she shrinks from personal
display and public observation. During her
residence in this city she has lived in the most perfect
privacy, never going to parties or soirees, never
giving such herself, refusing to enlarge her circle
of friends, and finding full employment as well as
satisfaction in her domestic and literary duties.
She has probably received more invitations to private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
and public assemblies, and her acquaintance
has been more frequently sought by distinguished
persons, during the period of her residence here,
than any other individual. To all solicitations of
this kind she returns a mild but decided negative.
In the hotels at which she has resided, no one, neither
landlord nor guest, has ever known her as Fanny
Fern. Indeed, she has an abhorrence of personal
publicity, and cannot be persuaded to sacrifice any
part of the comfort of an absolute <i>incog.</i> We cannot
but approve her resolution.</p>

<p>"Fanny Fern is a sincerely religious woman, the
member of an evangelical denomination, and a
regular attendant at church. We never knew any
one who believed in a belief more strongly than
she in hers, or who was more deeply grieved when
that belief was treated with disrespect. No one
stands less in awe of conventionalities, no one is
more strict on a point of honor and principle than
she. She is a person who is able to do all that she
is convinced she ought, and to refrain from doing
all that she is sure she ought not. In strength of
purpose, we know not her equal among women.</p>

<p>"The word which best describes Fanny Fern is
the word Lady. All her ways and tastes are feminine
and refined. Everything she wears, every
article of furniture in her rooms, all the details of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
her table, must be clean, elegant, tasteful. Her attire,
which is generally simple and inexpensive, is
always exquisitely nice and becoming. In the
stormiest days, when no visitor could be expected,
she is as carefully dressed and adorned as though
she was going to court. We say as carefully,
though, in fact, she has a quick instinct for the
becoming, and makes herself attractive without
bestowing much time or thought upon the matter.
Her voice is singularly musical; her manner varies
with her humor; but it is always that of a lady.
One who knows Fanny Fern has an idea what
kind of women they must have been for whom
knights-errant did battle in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>"With all her strength, Fanny Fern is extremely
sensitive. She can enjoy more, suffer more, love
more, hate more, admire more and detest more,
than any one whom we have known. With all
her gentleness of manner, there is not a drop of
milk and water in her veins. She believes in
having justice done. Seventy times and seven she
could forgive a repentant brother; but not once,
unless he repented.</p>

<p>"Fanny Fern writes rapidly, in a large, bold
hand; but she sends no article away without very
careful revision; and her manuscript is puzzling
to printers from its numberless erasures and insertions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
She writes from her heart and her eye;
she has little aptitude or taste for abstract thought.
She never talks of her writings, and cares little for
criticism, however severe. She is no more capable
of writing an intentional <i>double entendre</i>, than the
gross-minded men who have accused her of doing
so are capable of appreciating the worth of pure
womanhood.</p>

<p>"Such are some of our impressions of Fanny
Fern, to which we may add, that she has the finest
form of any woman in New York, and that no
one of the names recently assigned her in the
papers is her true name. In ordinary circumstances,
we should not have thought it right thus
to describe the characteristics of a lady; our sole,
and we think, sufficient justification is, the publication
of statements respecting her, only less vulgar
than calumnious."

THE OTHER SIDE.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
The following review of Ruth Hall is from the
pen of a talented woman, far above any feelings
of pique or jealousy.</p>

<p class="p2">
"Our first recollections of 'Fanny Fern' are
connected with her appearance in the Olive
Branch a few years since. We were then entirely
ignorant of her real name and position, nor did
we, in common with the indifferent public, feel
any particular interest or curiosity respecting
them. The impression of the careless reader
would have been that the spicy scraps bearing this
signature were the production of some hoydenish
school-girl, ambitious to see her writings in print.
With the supposition that they were the work of
a young lady, was associated an indefinite, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
slightly painful feeling that the writer was not
sufficiently endowed with female delicacy. While
a perfect sketch, artistically wrought out, and
disfigured by no defects of style or coarse inuendoes,
partially filled a column, the same column
often contained another article, full of these blemishes.
Vulgar expressions and exclamations were
often used, though when these writings were afterwards
collected and published in a book, these
were carefully pruned away. Some judicious
friend had evidently guided the pen to strike out
phraseology which would have been injurious if
not fatal to Fanny's rising fame. Whether this
judicious friend was the 'Mr. Tibbetts' through
whose agency her first work was introduced to the
publishers, who received and forwarded to her all
the proofs, reading the whole aloud to her as fast
as it appeared in type, we are not able to say.
Upon 'Fern Leaves,' and successive volumes, thus
carefully pruned of what too plainly revealed a
certain coarseness in the habits of thought of the
writer, the public has doubtless passed a just
verdict. With the fame thus won, and the independence
thus secured, would that 'Fanny Fern'
had been satisfied.</p>

<p>"We do not intend to attempt an elaborate
review of 'Ruth Hall.' As a novel it will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
bear it. We have read it through twice without
catching any clew to its merits or intentions as a
work of art. Disjointed fragments of what should
be a beautiful and complete edifice, are all that
meet the eye. As in the newly discovered remains
of ancient cities, monstrous faces, caricatures
of humanity, glare upon us when we look for
'the human face divine.' One cannot but feel
that the mind of the artist must have been itself
deformed to have designed such monstrosities. On
looking over the preface, we perceive that the
author disclaims the intention of writing a novel.
We will therefore examine 'Ruth Hall' as an
auto-biography.</p>

<p>"A work which appears before the world, heralded
as such, with the evident intention of being
so understood, should above all else, be distinguished
for truth. Exaggerated, instead of
correct descriptions, imaginary instead of real conversations
and letters, which if genuine, have no
point, and if fictitious, no interest, should not
have been admitted to its pages. The work
abounds in these. If 'Ruth Hall' is 'Fanny
Fern,' then the incognito of the latter is forever
laid aside. Half the charm attached to her writings
has already vanished. She is no longer a
'Maid of the Mist,' whose silvery veil conceals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
deformities and enhances beauties, but plain 'Fanny
Fern;' and 'Ruth Hall' is 'Fanny Fern'
described by herself. Let us look at this description.</p>

<p>"'Ruth Hall' is not without vanity. In the
very first chapter, 'her lithe form had rounded
into <i>symmetry</i> and <i>grace</i>, her slow step had become
<i>light</i> and <i>elastic</i>, her <i>smile winning</i>, and her <i>voice
soft</i> and <i>melodious</i>.'</p>

<p>"Again on page 48th.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
'It was blessed to see the love light in Ruth's <i>gentle</i> eyes;
to see the <i>rose</i> chase the lily from her cheek; to see the old
spring come back to her step; to follow her from room to
room while she draped the pretty white curtains, and <i>beautified
unconsciously everything she touched</i>.'</p>
</div>

<p>"We have not space for farther quotations, but
must refer our readers to the 59th, 61st, 70th, and
other pages of the work, not forgetting the lengthy
and flattering phrenological description commencing
at page 278.</p>

<p>"Another very striking characteristic of 'Ruth
Hall' is her want of filial piety. If we omit
the evidences of this, half the book disappears.
Whether the parents of her deceased husband,
respect for whose memory at least should have
restrained her pen, or her own relatives, become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
the subjects of her notice, vulgar ridicule and
pointless wit are unsparingly lavished upon them.
Whatever may have been the faults of those connected
with 'Fanny Fern's' past history, a decent
self-respect should have withheld her from thus
parading them before the world. It is well known
to the public that 'Fanny Fern' has been twice
married, but all allusion to this circumstance is
omitted in 'Ruth Hall.' How are we then to
know that this suppressed history may not contain
a partial justification of the course pursued by
her friends? One intimate with her first husband,
long ago informed us that she was a 'poor housekeeper,'
and 'did not make him a comfortable
home.' We have therefore been half inclined to
sympathize with 'Mrs. Hall's' lamentations over
the missing accomplishment of bread-making.</p>

<p>"But for infringing on the sacredness of communications
intended to be private, we could give
a different aspect to other allusions in 'Ruth Hall.'
Whatever may have been the defects of 'Hyacinth
Ellet,' he has never publicly failed to 'know
his father and his mother.' The gray hairs which
'are a crown of glory when found in the way of
righteousness,' should have shielded an aged parent
from the irreverent attacks of the daughter,
and the hollow cough of an invalid struggling with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
a yet more pitiless foe, should have found its way
to the heart of the sister. When the clods of the
valley shall rest upon the heads of both father and
brother, we shall not envy the emotions of 'Fanny
Fern.'</p>

<p>"'Ruth Hall' proves herself capable of ingratitude.
Her earliest benefactor, the kind-hearted
and benevolent man who first encouraged and
rewarded her timid efforts, has not been safe from
her attacks, even in the grave. Later friends
have been as unhesitatingly deserted and abused.
Well may they feel 'how sharper than a serpent's
tooth it is, to have a thankless' friend. By the
aid of these, she stepped from obscurity into public
notice, and now 'has no farther occasion for
her stepping-stones.'</p>

<p>"But self-esteem, ingratitude, and want of filial
piety, are venial sins compared with the irreverence
for things sacred, which sullies the pages of
'Ruth Hall.' The conversation of the dressmaker,
that of Mr. Ellet with his ministerial
friend, the allusion to Hyacinth's description of
the Saviour, with many other briefer passages,
had they been written by Dickens, would have
been pronounced impious. Written by a professed
Christian, what then shall we call them? Filial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
disrespect and religious irreverence are blended in
almost every page.</p>

<p>"But 'Ruth Hall' is represented as a model
woman, and an exemplary Christian. All that
'Fanny Fern's' descriptive talent could do to
throw a charm about her character has been done.
Whether the defects of the heroine thus unintentionally
betrayed, may not lessen our desire to
copy this model, we will leave the unprejudiced
reader to judge. One deeply read in human
nature has said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"'Sweet are the uses of adversity</p>
<p>Which like the toad, ugly and venomous,</p>
<p>Wears yet a precious jewel in its head.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Knowing how 'sweet are the uses of adversity'
rightly received and improved, we cannot
but regret that 'Fanny Fern's' adversity should
have left to her so much of the 'venomous.'</p>

<p>"Out of four hundred pages in 'Ruth Hall'
seventy-five are entirely blank. Had the remaining
pages been left equally so, we believe it would
have been better for 'Fanny Fern' and for the
world."

This individual, Fanny Fern says:&mdash;"Is jolly,

Squeezes himself into an infinitessimal fragment,
in the corner of an omnibus, to make room for

cab-drivers off the only dry crossing, to save a

CATCHING THE DEAR.&mdash;BY FANNY

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"A Roman lady who takes a liking to a foreigner does not
cast her eyes down when he looks at her, but fixes them upon
him long and with evident pleasure. If the man of her
choice feels the like sentiment, and asks&mdash;'Are you fond of
me?' she replies with the utmost frankness, 'Yes, my
dear.'"</p>
</div>

<p>You double-distilled little simpleton! don't you
know better than that? Don't you know that
courtship is like a vast hunting party?&mdash;<i>all the
pleasure lies in the pursuit?</i> That the sport is all
over when the <i>deer</i> is caught? Certainly; you
don't catch an American girl 'doing as the Romans
do.' <i>She</i> understands the philosophy of the thing,
and don't drop down like a shot pigeon at the first
arrow from Cupid's quiver. If she is wounded
ever so bad, she spreads her wings and flies off,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
alighting here, there, and everywhere; leading her
pursuer through bog, ditch and furrow; sometimes
flapping her bright wings close to his face, and
then, out of sight&mdash;the mischief knows where&mdash;to
return again the next minute. In this way she
finds out how much trouble he is willing to take
for her; and the way he knows how to prize her
when she is caught would astonish your Roman
comprehension, my dear.</p>

<p>"Now, I never saw a masculine Roman, but I
will just tell you, in passing, that American gentlemen
go by the rule of contraries. If there are
any of them whom you desire <i>most particularly not
to be bored with</i>, all you have to do is to make a pretence
of the most <i>intense</i> desire for their acquaintance;
and vice-versa.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul! you haven't got so far as A,
B, C; you are in an <i>awful</i> benighted state for
a female. I labored under the impression that
the Foreign Mission Society had attended to the
evangelization of Rome. I'll have some 'col-porteurs'
sent over, without loss of time&mdash;you
little verdant Abigail! saying 'yes, my dear,' the
minute you are 'looked at!' If I hadn't so many
irons in the fire I'd attend to your education
myself, you poor, ignorant little heathen!"</p>

HELEN, THE VILLAGE ROSE-BUD.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
The following tearful sketch was contributed by
Fanny Fern to the True Flag, under the name
of 'Olivia.' It is one of Fanny's sweetest efforts.</p>

<p class="p2">
"You couldn't help loving our 'Village Rose-bud.'
Not because she was beautiful, though
those pouting lips and deep blue eyes were fair to
see; nor because her form had caught the grace
of the waving willow; nor for the gleaming brightness
of her golden hair. But because her sable
dress bespoke your tender pity for the orphan;
and for the thousand little nameless acts of love
and kindness, prompted by her gentle and affectionate
heart.</p>

<p>"The first sweet violets that opened their blue
eyes to greet the balmy spring, the earliest fruits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
of summer, and autumn's golden favors, were laid
as trophies at her feet. For each and all, she had
a gentle, kindly word, and a beaming smile; none
felt that their offerings would be overlooked or
slighted, because they were unpretending.</p>

<p>"Helen Gray's means and home were humble,
but the apartment she occupied in the house of the
kind Widow More might have vied for taste and
comfort with many more expensively furnished.
The tasteful arrangement of a few choice books
and pictures; the flower-stand, with its wealth of
sweet blossoms; the tiny porcelain vase, that daily
chronicled the hopes of her rustic admirers as expressed
in the shape of rose-buds, heart's-ease,
mignonette, and the like; the snowy curtain,
looped gracefully away from the window, over
which the wild-rose and honey-suckle formed a
fairy frame for the sweet face that so often bewildered
the passing traveller&mdash;many an hour did she
sit there, watching the fleecy cloud; the fragrant
meadow, through which the tiny stream wound
like a thread of silver; the waving trees, with
their leafy music; the church, with its finger of
faith pointing to Heaven; and the village graveyard,
where were peacefully pillowed the gray-haired
sire and loving mother, whom she still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
mourned; and each and all wound their own spell
around the heart and fancy of the orphan Helen.</p>

<p>"But there is yet another spell that holds her in
its silken fetters. Ah, little Helen! by those
morning walks and star-lit rambles, by that rose
fresh with dew, glittering amid your ringlets, by
those dainty little notes, that bring such a bright
flush to your cheek and add such lustre to your
eyes; you are a <i>plighted</i> maiden.</p>

<p>"Harry Lee knew well how to woo, and win
'the village rose-bud.' Master of a handsome fortune,
he had early exhausted all the sources of enjoyment
to be found in his native city. For the
last three years he had been a voluntary exile in
foreign lands; he had daguerreotyped upon his
memory all that was grand, majestic and lovely,
in natural beauty; all that was perfect in painting
and sculpture. He had returned home, weary in
the search of pleasure, sick of artificial manners
and etiquette, longing for something that would
interest him.</p>

<p>"In such a mood he met Helen. Her naive manners,
her innocent and childish beauty, captivated
his fancy. He was rich enough to be able to
please himself in the choice of a wife, and the
orphan's sweet gentleness gave promise of a ready
compliance with every selfish desire. As to Helen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
she had only her own heart to ask. All the villagers
thought 'Mr. Lee was such a <i>handsome</i> man.'
<i>Mr. Lee thought so himself.</i></p>

<p>"Fair and bright shone the sun on Helen's
bridal morning! No father, nor mother, nor
brother, nor sister, were there to give the young
bride away. She had yielded her innocent and
guileless heart without a fear for the future. Her
simple toilette required little care. The golden
tresses, the graceful, symmetrical figure, the sweet
face, over which the faint blush flitted with every
passing emotion, could gain nothing by artificial
adornment.</p>

<p>"Helen could have been happy with her husband
in a far less costly, less luxurious home; but well
did she grace its fair halls. Her perfect and intuitive
tact served her in place of experience of
the gay world. Her husband was amused as well
as gratified at her ease and self-possession, and
marked with pride the world's admiration of his
choice.</p>

<p>"It is needless to say how the orphan's heart
went out to him who was <i>all</i> to her. With what
fond pride she looked up to him whom she believed
to be all that was noble, good and true&mdash;how delicately
she anticipated every wish, and dissipated
by her sunny brightness every cloud of care.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>"How perfect and far-sighted that Wisdom that
shrouds the future from our sight! Who among
us, with rude hand, would willingly draw back the
dark curtain, and palsy the hearts now beating high
with hope and promise?</p>

<p>"Time passed on, and Helen had another claimant
for her love. Never was infant so caressed by
a doating mother; never one whose little lamp of
life needed such careful watching lest it should be
extinguished.</p>

<p>"Helen looked in vain to read in her husband's
eyes the love she felt for her child. Its cries were
intolerable to him, and the quiet and tedium of a
sick-room annoying to the last degree. He missed
the light step that bounded to meet him on his return,
the bright face that smiled upon him at their
quiet meal, the touch of fairy fingers on his heated
brow. He thought not of a mother's pain; he felt
no gratitude for the life that had been spared him;
he had no admiration for the patient devotion of
the young mother. He took not into account the
monotony of a sick-room to a nervous, excitable
temperament like Helen's; he looked not beyond
his own selfish feelings.</p>

<p>"Helen was grieved, yet she would not admit to
herself that Harry had changed. She made an
effort to appear stronger and brighter than she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
really was, and in the unselfishness of her love she
said, 'It must be <i>I</i> who have changed; I will yet
win him back to me.' But her babe was feeble,
and required much of her time, and Harry's brow
would cloud with displeasure when the eyes of his
gentle wife would fill with tears; then with an impatient
'pshaw!' he would leave the room, 'wondering
what nurses were made for, if they couldn't
keep babies from being a bore.'</p>

<p>"Poor Helen! All this told upon her feeble
health and spirits; she became nervous and hysterical,
and trembled when she heard Harry's
footsteps. She consulted her glass to see if sickness
had robbed her of the charms that had won
him. Still it reflected back the same wealth of
golden hair, the fair, pure brow, the sweet blue
eyes. The rose had faded from her cheek, 'tis true,
but that would bloom again with exercise and fresh
air; and so she redoubled her attentions, patiently
counting the tedious hours of his unwonted absence,
nor met him with an ungentle word or look
of reproach on his return.</p>

<p>"Helen had often met, at the house of a friend
of Harry's, a young widow lady by the name of
Melville. One day her husband told her that he
wished an invitation to be sent to her to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
them a visit, adding, 'she will cheer you up and
help you appear more like yourself again.'</p>

<p>"The next week found Norah Melville their
guest. Married at the age of nineteen to a man
the age of her father, she found herself a year after
a widow, with unimpaired beauty, and a fortune
sufficiently ample to cover every want or desire.
She had a thorough knowledge of human nature,
and was a perfect woman of the world. Her
figure was tall and queenly, she had large liquid
black eyes, a complexion of marble paleness, a
profusion of raven black hair, and a voice like the
wind-harp in its sweetness. She knew that eyes
like hers were made for <i>use</i>, and she <i>acted upon that
principle</i>.</p>

<p>"Nothing could exceed her kindness to Helen,
who only saw that her husband's old glad smile
had come back again, and that he was once more
gay and cheerful.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Melville sang them all her choicest songs,
always appeared in an unexceptionable toilette,
displayed a foot equal to Cinderella's, and was, by
turns, pensive or gay, thoughtful or witty, brilliant
or sad; but in all <i>bewitching</i>!</p>

<p>"Helen could see nothing exceptionable in her
manners or conversation, and agreed with the rest
of her admirers that she was a 'splendid woman.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>"One day, as they sat at dinner, a proposal was
made by Harry that they should attend the theatre
that evening. Helen dared not leave her child
until so late an hour, but begged them not to stay
at home on her account. When the hour arrived
she herself placed the spotless camellia in Mrs.
Melville's raven hair, clasped the glittering diamond
bracelet upon her fair, round arm, and went
back, in the guilelessness of her trusting heart, to
her child's cradle.</p>

<p>"At length, weary with its restlessness, she
threw herself upon the bed and sank into a deep
slumber. She dreamed of the flower-wreathed
cottage where her childhood was passed, and in
fancy she roamed with Harry in the sweet meadows,
and revisited the old trysting-place under the
trees by the river side, and heard his words of
passionate love as in those golden days. She
awoke and found the hour was late for Harry's
return. Descending the stairs, she bent her footsteps
toward the parlor.</p>

<p>"Transfixed, spell-bound, what has hushed the
tread of those tiny, slipperless feet upon the soft
carpet?</p>

<p>"The moonbeams fell brightly through the large
bay window upon the fair Norah. Her opera-cloak
had fallen carelessly at her side, displaying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
her matchless neck and snowy arms. Her eyes,
those speaking, <i>bewildering</i> eyes, were bent upon
Harry, who sat on a low ottoman at her feet. His
hair was pushed carelessly back from his broad
white brow, and Helen was no stranger to the
look with which he gazed upon Mrs. Melville.
Musically slow, but with dreadful distinctness, fell
upon her ear the words,</p>

<p>"'Norah, I love you.'</p>

<p>"In that short sentence was compressed for the
gentle wife the agony of death. None but those
who have given a warm, living heart into unworthy
keeping, may know such torture.</p>

<p>"Helen spoke not, nor gave other sign of her
presence. Slowly, mechanically, she returned to
her room, and, as she sank into a chair, the words
'My God, pity me!' were wrung from her soul's
anguish.</p>

<p>"When Harry returned, she sat cold and pale,
swaying her figure gently to and fro, slowly repeating,</p>

<p>"'Norah, I love you! Norah, I love you!'</p>

<p>"In the lunatic asylum of &mdash;&mdash;, may now be
seen 'the Village Rosebud.' God forgive the careless
hand that so rudely plucked its fresh beauty,
but to blight its fair promise, and cast it aside as a
withered thing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

No tyrannical frock-coats, or 'dress-coats,' or

THAT MRS. JONES.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
We don't quite agree with Fanny in thinking
women ought to bear all the blame. Eve never
would have thought of stealing apples, if Adam
hadn't been in a hurry for his supper. But in this
instance Mrs. Jones <i>was</i> wrong. This is the story,
as Fanny tells it:</p>

<p class="p2">
"'Heaven be praised for Sunday,' said Mrs.
Jones; 'when omnibus horses and women can rest
from their labors. Mr. Jones? Bless my soul, the
man has gone;' and she raised herself on her elbow,
and pushed back the ruffled border of her nightcap,
as if to make quite sure of her single blessedness.
'Tommy?' said she, to a little trundle-bed
occupant; 'here, Tommy, you always know everything
you ought <i>not</i> to; where's your father?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>"'Oh, he went off an hour since,' said the urchin;
'took his money-trunk and went down
street.'</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jones leaped into the middle of the floor,
examined the contents of wardrobe and closets.
Yes&mdash;his clothes were all there; she couldn't decide
whether she was a 'California widow' or not;
the chances were about even.</p>

<p>"'Six little mouths to feed,' said she; 'house-rent
to pay, and myself to keep out of mischief.
Shouldn't have minded <i>his</i> going, if he hadn't kidnapped
that money-trunk; he was getting dyspeptic
and fussy, <i>rather</i> inclining to be <i>ancient</i>;' and
she shook out her curls from under her cap, and
attempted to finish her breakfast toilette.</p>

<p>"'T-o-m-m-y Jones,' said she; 'leave off shaving
that cat, with your father's razor. Do you
know what day it is?'</p>

<p>"'Well, you'd better ask father,' said the young
hopeful. 'There he is, coming up the street with a
money-trunk in his hand, of a Sunday morning.'</p>

<p>"'M-r. Jo-n-e-s,' said his spouse, as that gentleman
came in, and walking so close up to him that
their noses touched&mdash;'<i>have you been imbibing?</i>
What did you get up so early for? and where on
earth have you been? and which way did you go?
and what have you been about? Make haste, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
tell me! Pretty example for you to set this baptized
Tommy&mdash;to be running round, Sunday morning,
before sunrise, with a money-trunk under your
arm. What do you suppose our minister'll think?'</p>

<p>"'<i>Sunday morning!</i>' said Jones, rubbing his
forehead&mdash;'Sunday morning! That accounts!
Couldn't think, for the life of me, why there wasn't
a window-shutter taken down in the street. Been
down to the store, as true as I'm a sinner; made
the fire; opened the shutters, and hung out all the
calicoes and ribbons and streamers I could find.
<i>Sunday Morning!</i> Well, it's all <i>your</i> fault, Mrs.
Jones; how was <i>I</i> to know? You didn't have <i>salt
fish for dinner, yesterday, though it was Saturday</i>&mdash;that's
the only way I know when Sunday comes.
Shouldn't make innovations, Mrs. Jones; it's all
your fault. There never was a commandment
broke yet, that a <i>woman</i> wasn't at the bottom
of it.'"

MRS. JUPITER'S SOLILOQUY, TAKEN
DOWN IN SHORT-HAND.&mdash;BY FANNY
FERN.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Sitting is the only posture for deliberation.
Certainly. Don't 'the House' always 'sit'
when any national egg is hatching? The philosophy
and naturalness of the maxim is unmistakeably
obvious. It accounts, too, for something I've
never been able to comprehend, viz., how in the
name of all that's astounding I became Mrs. Jonas
Jupiter. I was not sitting when Jonas laid his
moustache at my feet. If the Legislature would
give me a chance to reconsider the subject, gunpowder
shouldn't take me off my chair till I did
it ample justice. Jonas probably knew what he
was about, when he imposed on my simplicity
that way. Nicodemus! to think I should have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
made such a life-time mistake, all for want of a
chair! My veneration for furniture will be on the
progressive for the future. I incline to the opinion
that men are exceedingly artful. It's surprising
how like Moses they can <i>talk</i>, and how like
Judas they can <i>act</i>. If it wasn't that I'm bound
to collect their mental skeletons to hang up in my
dissecting-room, I should eschew the whole sex.
But 'tis a pretty little amusement to the female
naturalist to label the different specimens. As far
as my scientific research extends, they have one
defect in common, viz., that where the heart should
be, there is a decided vacuum. It is a trifling oversight
of Dame Nature's which her elbow should be
jogged to rectify in her future productions. This
little amendment in the masculine organization
would be excruciatingly refreshing to the female
lover of variety. No amount of brains, in my
opinion, is an equivalent for this omission, but
when heart and brains are <i>both lacking</i>!&mdash;saints
and angels, what an abortion!</p>

THE UNFAITHFUL LOVER.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
We quote, by permission, from the files of the
True Flag, a second sketch, contributed to
its columns, by Olivia, <i>alias</i> Fanny Fern.</p>

<p class="p2">
"Kate Stanley was a brilliant, sparkling brunette.
Wo to the rash youth who exposed his
heart to <i>her</i> fascinations! If he were not annihilated
by the witching glance of her bright eye, he
would be sure to be caught by the dancing dimple
that played 'hide-and-seek' so roguishly in her
rosy cheek, or the little rounded waist that supported
her faultless bust, or the tiny feet that crept,
mice-like, in and out from under the sweeping folds
of her silken robe.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say, Miss Kitty was an <i>arrant
coquette</i>. She angled for hearts with the skill of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
practised sportsman, and was never satisfied till
she saw them quivering and bleeding at her feet;
<i>then</i>, they might flounce and flutter, and twist and
writhe at their leisure, it was no farther concern
of <i>hers</i>. She was off for a new subject.</p>

<p>"One fine morning she sat listlessly in her boudoir,
tapping one little foot upon the floor, and
sighing for a new sensation, when a note was
handed her. It ran thus:</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Dear Kitty</span>:&mdash;Our little cottage home is
looking lovely, this 'leafy June.' Are you not
weary of city life? Come and spend a month
with us, and refresh heart and body. You will
find nothing <i>artificial</i> here, <i>save yourself</i>!</p>

<p class="left45">
'Yours,</p>
<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Nelly</span>.'</p>

<p>"'Just the thing,' said Kitty, 'but the girl must
be crazy, or intolerably vain, to bring me into such
close contact with her handsome lover&mdash;I might as
well try to stop breathing as to stop flirting, and the
<i>country</i> of <i>all</i> places, for a flirtation! The girl
must be <i>non-compos</i>; however, it's her own affair,
not mine;' and she glanced triumphantly at her
beautiful face, and threaded her jewelled fingers
through her long ringlets, and conquered him&mdash;<i>in
imagination</i>!</p>

<p>"'When do you expect your friend?' said a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
laughing young girl to Nelly. 'From the descriptions
I have had of her, your bringing her here,
will be something akin to the introduction of Satan
into Paradise. You wouldn't find <i>me</i> guilty of
such a folly, were I engaged to your handsome
Fitz. Now you know, Nelly dear, that although
you are fascinating and intellectual, you have no
pretensions to beauty, and there are few men who
prize a gem unless it is <i>handsomely set</i>, however
great its value. Now be warned in time, and send
him off on a pilgrimage till her visit is over. <i>I</i>
won't bet on his constancy!'</p>

<p>"'On the contrary,' said Nelly, as she rose
slowly from the little couch where she was reclining,
and her small figure grew erect and her large
eyes lustrous, 'I would marry no man who could
not pass through such an ordeal and remain true
to me. I am, as you see, hopelessly plain and ungraceful;
yet, from my earliest childhood, I have
been a passionate worshipper of beauty. I never
expected to win love&mdash;I never expected to marry&mdash;and
when Fitz, with all his glorious beauty,
sued for my hand, I could not convince myself
that it was not all a bewildering dream. It was
such a temptation to a heart so isolated as mine;
and eloquently it plead for itself. When I drank
in the music of his voice, I said, 'surely I must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
lovely in <i>his</i> eyes; else why has he sought me?'
Then, in my solitary moments, I said, sadly, 'there
are none to dispute the prize with me here. He
is deceiving himself; he is only in love with
nature and the beautiful about us. He has mistaken
his own heart.' Then again, I would ask
myself, 'can nothing but <i>beauty</i> win a noble heart?
are all my intellectual gifts valueless?' And still,
Fitz unable to understand my contradictory moods,
passionately urged his suit. It needed not that
waste of eloquence; my heart was already captive.
And now, by the intensity of that happiness of
which I know myself to be capable, I will prove
him. Kate's beauty&mdash;Kate's witchery, shall be
the test! If his heart remains loyal to me, I am
his. If not&mdash;' and her cheek grew pale, and large
tears gathered slowly in her eyes&mdash;'I have saved
myself a deeper misery.'</p>

<p>"Fitz Allan 'had travelled,' and that is generally
understood to mean to go abroad and remain
a period of time long enough to grow a fierce
beard and fiercer moustache, and cultivate a
thorough contempt for everything in your own
country. This was not true of Fitz Allan. It
had only bound him the more closely to home and
friends. His splendid person and cultivated manners
had been a letter of recommendation to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
in cultivated society. He was no fop, and yet he
was fully aware of these personal advantages.
(What handsome man is not?) He had trophies
of all kinds, to attest his skillful generalship; such
as dainty satin slippers, tiny kid gloves, faded
roses, ringlets of all colors, ebony, flaxen and
auburn, and <i>bijouterie</i> without limit.</p>

<p>"Happy Fitz! What spell bound thee to the
plain, but loveable Nelly? A nature essentially
feminine; a refined, cultivated taste; a warm,
passionate heart. Didst thou remember when
thou listenedest to that most musical of musical
voices, and sat hour after hour, magnetised by its
rare witchery as it glanced gracefully and skillfully
from one topic to another, that its possessor had
not the grace and beauty of a Hebe or a Venus?</p>

<p>"It was a bright, moonlight evening. Fitz and
Nelly were seated in the little rustic parlor opening
upon the piazza. The moon shone full upon
Kate, as she stood in the low door-way. Her simple
white dress was confined at the waist by a
plain, silken cord. Her fair, white shoulders rose
gracefully from the snowy robe. Her white arms,
as they were crossed upon her breast, or raised
above her head to catch playfully the long tendrils
of the woodbine, as the wind swept them past her
forehead, gleamed fair in the moonlight, and each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
and all had their bewildering charm. She seated
herself upon the low door-step. Song after song
was borne upon the air. Her eyes now flashing
with the enthusiasm of an Improvisatrice&mdash;then
soft, and lustrous, and liquid, and&mdash;dangerous!
Nelly's heart beat quick&mdash;a deep crimson spot
glowed upon her cheek, and, for once, <i>she</i> was
beautiful.</p>

<p>"Kate, apparently, took but little notice of the
lovers, but not an expression that flitted across
the fine face of Fitz Allan passed unnoticed by
her. And she said proudly to herself&mdash;'<i>I have
conquered him!</i>'</p>

<p>"And so the bright summer months passed by,
and they rambled through the cool woods and rode
through the winding paths and sang to the quiet
stars in the dim, dewy night.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>"'Fie! Mr. Fitz Allan! What would Nelly
say, to see you kneeling here at my feet? You
forget you are an affianced lover,' said the gay
beauty, as she mockingly curled her rosy lip;
'when you address such flattering language to
<i>me</i>!'</p>

<p>"'I only know that you are <i>beautiful as a dream</i>,'
said the bewildered Fitz, as he passionately kissed
the jewelled hand that lay unresistingly in his own.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>"That night Fitz might be seen pacing his room
with rapid strides, crushing in his hands a delicate
note, in which was written these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"'The <i>moon looks on many brooks</i>;</p>

AN HOUR WITH FANNY'S FATHER.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Since the previous pages were prepared, we
have been favored with an interesting history
of a recent interview with Fanny Fern's father, by
a gentleman of Boston, upon whose statements
implicit reliance may be placed.</p>

<p>As any facts relating to the venerable parent of
so distinguished a woman as Fanny, must be of
interest to the public, we have concluded to devote
a chapter to a condensed account of the interview
in question.</p>

<p>Deacon Willis was found at his office in School
street, at an early hour on a winter morning,
engaged in looking over some business matters
with his book-keeper. The veteran publisher is
described as a person rather below the medium
stature; gray-haired and feeble; slightly bent with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
age and care; dressed in a sober suit of black,
with white cravat, and spectacles.</p>

<p>The conversation turning upon "Ruth Hall,"
the old gentleman shook his head sadly. Had he
read the book? Oh, no! he had not the heart to
do that. He had understood that he was abused
in it; but at his time of life, with the gates of
eternity drawing so near, and the world receding
so fast behind him, he felt no desire to know what
an ungrateful child would say of him. As far as
he could learn, the book had been read by none of
his family: they passed it by, as children shun a
reptile in their path. But he had seen notices of
it in the newspapers, from which he had learned
something concerning Fanny's treatment of her
relatives. It was needless for him to say how unjust
that treatment was. He had no defence to
make. And as for retaliation&mdash;he was still her
father; she was his child; he grieved not on
his own account, but for her sake&mdash;not because
evil was said of him in his old age, but because it
was in her heart to say it: what retaliation then
could he seek?</p>

<p>This last was not the first, nor by any means
the greatest trial Fanny had caused her parents.
From her girlhood, she had been a wild and
troublesome child. A total disregard for the feelings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
of others, was a distinguishing characteristic
of her disposition. Selfish and wilful, all attempts
to control her, excited only passion and spite. No
pains had been spared to soften and tame her.
The most celebrated teachers were employed. Not
only did Miss Catherine E. Beecher try her skill
upon her, but schools at Pittsfield, Mass., at Londonderry,
N. H., and at several other places, were
patronized, one after the other, with quite indifferent
success. At the termination of each fruitless
effort to mould her character, Miss Fanny was
returned, wild and wilful as ever, upon her
parents' hands.</p>

<p>In the course of conversation, Fanny's complaints
of neglect and cruelty on the part of her
friends, were alluded to. Again the old man shook
his head sorrowfully. These complaints, he said,
were utterly without foundation; and to this statement
he added a fact, which Fanny and her
advisers will find it difficult to put out of sight.
During the brief widowhood of the self-styled
"Ruth Hall," her own father alone, paid out money
to the amount of eight hundred dollars, for her
support. For this, Mr. Willis can show receipts.
Add an equal sum contributed by her husband's
father, and we have not less than sixteen hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
dollars&mdash;certainly a snug little pension for Ruth
and her children to starve upon.</p>

<p>In this connection, the old gentleman had occasion
to remark, that, had he been less liberal in
the education and support of his children, he might
not now be compelled to go early in the morning
to his office, and remain late in the afternoon in all
sorts of weather, exerting his feeble strength to
obtain a livelihood, at an age when quiet and rest
from toil are most to be desired.</p>

<p>Instead of becoming less troublesome to her
friends as she grew older, Fanny seemed to
acquire with years additional power to harass and
distress them. At last came her separation from
Mr. Farrington, accompanied with inexpressible
mortification and pain to her family.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding her rash and undutiful conduct
they once more came to her relief, and she
was permitted to draw the same pension as when
a widow. She now commenced writing for the
papers, and under the stimulus of her first success
as an authoress, assumed an air of insufferable
insolence toward the old man, who, all her life,
had borne so patiently with her temper. More
than once she had angrily charged him with falsehood
to his face. Her letters to him were foolishly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
impertinent. It was with reluctance and grief
that Deacon Willis spoke of these things; but
they seemed wrung from him by a powerful sense
of the wrongs which had been heaped upon his
head.</p>

<p>When, at length, it was well known that Mrs.
Farrington was in the receipt of liberal pay from
the newspapers for which she wrote, her father
warned her, that, if she sent him any more such
unwomanly and unfilial notes as generally accompanied
her applications for money, her pension
would be stopped. She defied him, and the threat
was carried into execution. And now Fanny has
sought her revenge.</p>

<p>The old man spoke affectionately of his son, Mr.
N. P. Willis, whose touching tribute to his father
has been recently published. Throughout the interview
he had shown a subdued and Christian
temper, uttering unpleasant truths "more in sorrow
than in anger." It was affecting to listen to
him; and our informant states, that on coming
away, the reflection that this was the man whom
the "Old Ellet" in Fanny's book was intended
to caricature&mdash;a fact he had quite lost sight of&mdash;excited
a revulsion of feeling, which he devoutly
wished might be experienced by a few of the
adorers of poor, abused "Ruth Hall."</p>

JOHN BULL'S OPINION OF RUTH HALL.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
We clip the following critique on "Ruth Hall"
from the columns of the Albion, an able organ
of English sentiment.</p>

<p>"There are some books of which it is difficult
to speak as one could wish, for a variety of reasons.
<i>Ruth Hall</i> is such a one. We have watched the
career of Fanny Fern from the first, and have seen
but little in it to commend. Suddenly elevated to a
pinnacle of popularity, she has demeaned herself as
no right-minded woman should have done, and no
sensitive-minded woman could have done&mdash;throwing
out insinuations, that she was a very ill-used
woman; that her family neglected her; and finally,
that she 'had <i>no</i> family.' Her 'Fern Leaves,' of
which two series are before the public, are more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
or less an expansion of these or of congenial ideas&mdash;neglected
wives and sisters, hard-hearted fathers
and uncles, fatherless and suffering children, and
young but talented authoresses seeking a livelihood
by the pen, forming the bulk of the work.
'Ruth Hall' harps on the same strings; showing
how Ruth Hall got married; how Mr. Hall died;
how Mr. Hall's 'aged parents,' and the blood relatives
of Ruth Hall, <i>née</i> Ellet, chaffered about helping
her in her time of need, and how they didn't;
how she took to authorship, and wrote in the
newspapers under the signature 'Floy;' how she
became famous, and humbled her brother Hyacinth,
who had the good sense to discourage her
from the first; and how she has a friend in the
person of a Mr. Walter. This, and more of the
same sort, is the plot of 'Ruth Hall.' The book
is ostensibly published as a novel; but is intended&mdash;if
general report may be believed&mdash;as an autobiography
of Fanny Fern herself. If designed for
a novel, it is clumsy in construction, and full of
false sentiment and questionable morality. If
meant for an autobiography, it is a piece of malice
and impertinence. Admitting&mdash;what we do not
for a moment believe&mdash;the truth of the narrative,
we see no reason why it should be published, but
many excellent ones why it should not. An old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
proverb says, 'there is a skeleton in every family.'
It does not become this egotistical and querulous
dame, if she have one in hers, to parade it before
the world. It would be wiser to shut the door
on it. Such a book as this will win its writer
some praise&mdash;for there is talent in it&mdash;and give
her even more notoriety than she appears to possess.
We cannot, however, say that on the whole
it is creditable to the female head or the female
heart."

ORTHODOX TESTIMONY.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
The Congregational Journal, Concord, N. H.,
concludes a somewhat severe review, in the
following emphatic manner:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"The chapter wanting in the life of 'Ruth
Hall,' perhaps could be furnished by Mr. Samuel
P. Farrington, of Chicago, Ill., if he was her second
husband till he obtained a divorce from her; and
that such is the fact, who will deny? Who that
knows will take the responsibility of denying that
'Ruth Hall' alias 'Fanny Fern,' is the daughter
of Deacon Nathaniel Willis, of Boston, and that
N. P. Willis is her brother? And who will deny
that her first husband was a Mr. Eldredge, whose
father was a physician, and is now dead? Is not
the 'old Doctor' the father of 'Harry?' Is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
'Mr. Ellet' the father of 'Ruth,' and is not 'Hyacinth'
her brother? are questions which she will
not answer in the negative. We shall not ourselves
attempt any description of this book, but
having knowledge of some facts in the history of
its author, and believing that the outlines above
quoted are just, we have encumbered our columns
with the matter. If by so doing, we shall be the
means of increasing the readers of 'Ruth Hall,'
the responsibility of reading such an abominable
production will rest on themselves and not us."

ANOTHER FERN.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
I've been reading the Bible, to-day, and it strikes
me that our foremothers were not very correct
old ladies. Who flirted with the old serpent?
How came Sampson's hair cut off and his peepers
extinguished? Who perforated Jael's head with
tenpenny nails? How came Jonah sent on a
whale-ing voyage? Who helped Ananias tell
fibs? Who put Job up to swearing? Who
raised a perfect hurricane in good old Abram's
house! Who danced John the Baptist's head off
his shoulders, hey? I'd like to have you notice
(that's all,) what a stock we all sprung from.</p>

<p>"If <i>they</i> weren't tee-totally depraved, may I
never find out which of 'em I descended from!
They didn't seem to have the least consideration
for future generations 'long since unborn.' Now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
I don't calculate, myself, to feel responsible for
<i>their</i> capers. I've read somewhere, in Byron, I
believe, that every washtub must stand on its own
pedestal! (or something like that.) I don't believe
in saddling my shoulders with their old-fashioned
transgressions.</p>

<p>"Curious, though, isn't it? the mischief women
make in the world? Great pity Noah hadn't set
Mrs. Noah <i>adrift</i> when he 'took one of each kind
in the ark." I should rather have stood my
chance for a ducking, than to have been shut up
with such a 'promiskus' men-agerie. Noah was
a worthy old gentleman. No mention made of
his getting tipsy but once, I believe."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Nota Bene.</i>&mdash;We cannot help being a little amused at Fanny's comical
want of Scriptural information. Our Bible represents Jael as a <i>woman</i>, not
by any means "perforated with tenpenny nails," though she did try the "perforating"
experiment with excellent success, on the head of Sisera "the
captain of Jabin's army." Oh, wondrous Fanny, those early Sabbath-school
lessons must have been long ago forgotten!</p>

"THE BEST OF MEN HAVE THEIR
FAILINGS."</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Fanny doesn't think so. She expresses her
opinion as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"I wish I could ever take up a paper that
endorsed my liberal sentiments. I've always
warped to the opinion that good men were as safe
as hom&oelig;opathic pills. You don't suppose they
ever patronize false words or false weights, false
measures or false yardsticks? You don't suppose
they ever slander their neighbors after making a
long-winded exhortation in a vestry meeting?
You don't suppose they ever lift their beavers to a
long purse, and turn their backs on a thread-bare
coat? You don't suppose they ever bestow a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
charity to have it trumpeted in the newspapers?
You don't suppose when they trot devoutly to
meeting twice a day on Sunday, that they overhaul
their ledgers in the intermission? You don't
suppose they ever put doubtful-looking bank bills
in the contribution box? You don't suppose they
ever pay their minister's salary in consumptive
hens and damaged turkies? I wish people were
not so uncharitable and suspicious. It disgusts me
with human nature.</p>

<p>"Now if I once hear a man make a prayer, that's
enough said. After <i>that</i>, Gabriel couldn't make
me believe he was a sinner. If his face is of an
orthodox length, and his creed is dyed in the wool,
I consider him a prepared subject for the undertaker.
If his toes are on an evangelical platform,
I am morally certain his eyes never will go on a
'Tom Fool's errand.' If he has a proper reverence
for a church-steeple, I stake my life on it, his
conduct will be perpendicular. I should be perfectly
willing to pin my faith on his sleeve till the
final consummation of all things. Yes, I've the
most unswerving, indestructible, undying confidence
in any man who owns a copy of Watts'
Psalms and Hymns. Such a man <i>never</i> trips, or
if he does, you never <i>catch him</i> at it!"

THE MISTAKE OF A LIFE-TIME.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
In a very different spirit the following sketch
was written:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"A lover's quarrel! A few hasty words, a
formal parting between two hearts, that neither
time nor distance could ever disunite; then&mdash;a
lifetime of misery!</p>

<p>"Edith May stood before me in her bridal
dress. The world was to be made to believe she
was happy and heart-whole. I knew better. I
knew that no woman who had once loved Gilbert
Ainslie could ever forget him; least of all such a
heart as Edith's. She was pale as a snow-wreath;
and bent her head as gracefully as a water lily, in
recognition of her numerous friends and admirers.</p>

<p>"'<i>What a sacrifice</i>,' the latter muttered, between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
their set teeth! 'What a sacrifice,' my heart
echoed back!</p>

<p>"Mr. Jefferson Jones was an ossified old
bachelor. He had but one idea in his head, and
that was, how to make money. There was only
one thing he understood equally well, and that
was, how to keep it. He was angular, prim, cold
and precise; mean, grovelling, contemptible and
cunning.</p>

<p>"And Edith! Our peerless Edith, whose lovers
were 'legion;' Edith, with her passionate heart,
her beauty, grace, taste and refinement; Edith to
vow 'love and honor' to such a soulless block!
It made me shudder to think of it! I felt as
though his very gaze was profanation.</p>

<p>"Well, the wedding was over; and she was
duly installed mistress of Jefferson House. She
had fine dresses, fine furniture, a fine equipage,
and the stupidest possible encumbrance, in the
shape of a husband.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jefferson Jones was very proud of his
bride; firstly, because she added to his importance,
secondly, because he plumed himself not a little in
bearing off so a dainty a prize. It gave him a
malicious pleasure to meet her old admirers, with
the graceful Edith upon his arm. Of course she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
preferred <i>him</i> to them all; else, why did she
marry him?</p>

<p>"Then how deferential she was in her manner
since their marriage; how very polite, and how
careful to perform her duty to the letter. Mr.
Jones decided, with his usual acumen, that there
was no room for a doubt, on <i>that</i> point! He
noticed, indeed, that her girlish gaiety was gone;
but that was a decided improvement, according to
his views. She was <i>Mrs. Jones</i>, now, and meant
to keep all the whiskered popinjays at a respectful
distance. <i>He liked it!</i></p>

<p>"And so, through those interminable evenings,
Edith sat, playing long, stupid games of chess with
him, or listening (?) to his gains or losses in the
way of trade; or reading political articles of which
the words conveyed no ideas to her absent mind.</p>

<p>"She walked through the busy streets, leaning on
his arm, with an <i>unseen form</i> ever at her side; and
slept&mdash;(God forgive her!) next his heart, when <i>hers</i>
was <i>far away</i>! But when she was <i>alone!</i> no
human eye to read her sad secret! her small hands
clasped in agony, and her fair head bent to the
very dust,&mdash;<i>was he not avenged?</i></p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>"It was a driving storm; Mr. Jones concluded
to dine at a restaurant instead of returning home.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
He had just seated himself, and given his orders
to the obsequious waiter, when his attention was
attracted by the conversation of two gentleman
near him.</p>

<p>"'Have you seen la belle Edith, since her marriage,
Harry?'</p>

<p>"'No; I feel too much vexed with her. Such a
splendid specimen of flesh and blood to marry
such an idiot! all for a foolish quarrel with
Ainslie. You never saw such a wreck as it has
made of him. However, she is well punished; for,
with all her consummate tact and effort to keep up
appearances, it is very plain that she is the most
miserable woman in existence, as Mr. Jefferson
Jones, whom I have never seen, might perceive,
if he wasn't, as all the world says, the very prince
of donkeys.'</p>

<p>"Jones seized his hat, and rushed into the open
air, tugging at his neck-tie as if he was choking.
Six times he went, like a comet, round the square;
then, setting his beaver down over his eyes, in a
very prophetic manner, he turned his footsteps deliberately
homeward. It was but the deceitful
calm before the whirlwind!</p>

<p>"He found Edith, calm, pale, and self-possessed,
as usual. He was quite as much so, himself; even
went so far as to compliment her on a coquettish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
little jacket that fitted her rounded figure very
charmingly.</p>

<p>"'I'm thinking of taking a short journey, Edith,'
said he, seating himself by her side, and playing
with the silken cord and tassels about her waist.
'As it is wholly a business trip, it would hamper
me to take you with me&mdash;but <i>you'll hear from me</i>.
Meanwhile, you know how to amuse yourself;
hey, Edith?'</p>

<p>"He looked searchingly in her face. There was
no conscious blush, no change of expression, no
tremor of the frame. He might as well have
addressed a marble statue.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jefferson Jones was <i>posed</i>! Well, he bade
her one of his characteristic adieus; and when the
door closed, Edith felt as if a mountain weight had
been lifted off her heart. There was but one
course for her to pursue. She knew it; she had
already marked it out. She would deny herself
to all visitors; she would not go abroad till her
husband's return. She was strong in her purpose;
there should be no door left open for busy scandal
to enter. Of Ainslie, she knew nothing, save that
a letter reached her from him after her marriage,
which she had returned unopened.</p>

<p>"And so she wandered restlessly through those
splendid rooms, and tried, by this self-inflicted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
penance, to atone for the defection of her heart.
Did she take her guitar, old songs they had sang
together came unbidden to her lip; that book, too,
they had read. Oh, it was <i>all misery</i>! <i>turn where
she would</i>!</p>

<p>"Day after day passed by&mdash;no letter from Mr.
Jones! The time had already passed that was
fixed upon for his return, and Edith, nervous from
close confinement and the weary inward struggle,
started like a frightened bird, at every footfall.</p>

<p>"It came at last, the letter, sealed with black!
'He had been accidentally drowned&mdash;his hat was
found&mdash;all search for the body had been unavailing.'</p>

<p>"Edith was no hypocrite. She could not mourn
for him, save in the outward garb of woe; but
now that he was <i>dead</i>, conscience did its office.
She had not, in the eye of the world, been untrue;
but <i>there is an eye that searches deeper</i>! that scans
<i>thoughts</i> as well as actions.</p>

<p>"Ainslie was just starting for the continent by
order of a physician, when the news reached him.
A brief time he gave to decorum, and then they met!
It is needless to say what that meeting was. Days
and months of wretchedness were forgotten like
some dreadful dream. She was again his own
Edith, sorrowing, repentant, and happy!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>"They were sitting together, one evening;
Edith's hand was upon his shoulder, and her face
radiant as a seraph's. They were speaking of their
future home.</p>

<p>"'Any spot on the wide earth but this, dear
Ainslie. Take me away from these painful associations.'</p>

<p>"'Say you so, pretty Edith?' said a well-known
voice. 'I but tried that faithful heart of yours to
<i>prove it</i>! Pity to turn such a pretty comedy into
a tragedy, but I happen to be <i>manager</i> here, young
man,' said Mr. Jones, turning fiercely towards the
horror-struck Ainslie!</p>

<p>"The revulsion was too dreadful. Edith survived
but a week; Ainslie became hopelessly
insane."

A WIFE'S DEVOTION.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Fanny has very nice ideas on this subject
She says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"'Every wife needs a good stock of love to start
with.'</p>

<p>"<i>Don't</i> she! You are upon a sick bed! a little
feeble thing lies upon your arm, that you might
crush with one hand. You take those little velvet
fingers in yours, close your eyes, and turn your
head languidly to the pillow. Little brothers and
sisters, Carry, and Harry, and Fanny, and Frank,
and Willy, and Mary, and Kitty, (half a score)
come tiptoeing into the room, 'to see the new
baby.' It is quite an old story to 'nurse,' who
sits there like an automaton, while they give vent
to their enthusiastic admiration of its wee toes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
fingers, and make <i>profound inquiries</i>, which nobody
thinks best to hear! You look on with a
languid smile, and they pass out, asking 'why
they can't stay with dear mamma, and why they
mustn't play puss in the corner,' as usual?</p>

<p>"You wonder if your little croupy boy tied his
tippet on when he went to school, and whether
Betty will see that your husband's flannel is aired,
and if Peggy has cleaned the silver and washed off
the front door-steps, and what your blessed husband
is about, that he don't come home to dinner.
There sits old nurse, keeping up that dreadful
treadmill trotting, 'to quiet the baby,' till you
could fly through the key-hole in desperation.</p>

<p>"The odor of dinner begins to creep up stairs&mdash;you
wonder if your husband's pudding will be
made right, and if Betty will remember to put
wine in the sauce, as he likes it; and then the perspiration
starts out on your forehead, as you hear
a thumping on the stairs, and a child's suppressed
scream; and nurse swathes the baby up in flannel
to the tip of its nose, dumps it down in the easy-chair,
and tells you to 'leave the family to her,
and go to sleep.' Bye-and-bye she comes in, after
staying down long enough to get a refreshing cup
of coffee&mdash;and walks up to the bed with a bowl of
gruel, tasting it, and then <i>putting the spoon back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
into the bowl</i>. In the first place you hate gruel&mdash;in
the next, you couldn't eat it if she held a pistol to
your head, after <span class="smcap">THAT SPOON</span> has been in her
mouth; so you meekly suggest that it be set on
the table to cool, (hoping by some providential interposition,
it <i>may get tipped over</i>.) Well, she creeps
round your room with a pair of creaking shoes, and
a bran new gingham gown, that rattles like a paper
window-curtain, at every step; and smooths her
hair with your nice little head-brush, and opens a
drawer <i>by mistake</i> (?) 'thinking it was the baby's
drawer.' Then you hear little nails scratching on
the door; and Charley whispers through the key-hole&mdash;'Mamma,
Charley's tired; <i>please</i> let Charley
come in?' Nurse scowls, and says no; but you
intercede (poor Charley, he's only a baby himself.)
Well, he leans his little head wearily against the
pillow, and looks suspiciously at that little bundle
of flannel in nurse's lap. It's clear he's had a
hard time of it, <i>what with tears and molasses</i>! The
little shining curls that you have so often rolled
over your fingers, are a tangled mass; and you
long to take him, and make him comfortable, and
<i>cosset</i> him a little; and then the baby cries again,
and you turn your head to the pillow with a
smothered sigh. Nurse hears it, and Charley is
taken struggling from the room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>"You take your watch from under the pillow,
to see if husband won't be home soon, and then
look at nurse, who takes a pinch of snuff <i>over your
bowl of gruel</i>, and sits down nodding drowsily, with
the baby in alarming proximity to the fire. Now
you hear a <i>dear</i> step on the stairs. It's <i>your Charley</i>!
How bright he looks! and what nice fresh
air he brings with him from out doors! He parts
the bed-curtains, looks in, and pats you on the
cheek. You just want to lay your head on his
shoulder, and have such a <i>splendid cry</i>! but there
sits that old Gorgon of a nurse&mdash;she don't believe
in husbands, <i>she</i> don't! You make Charley a free
mason sign to send her down stairs for something.
He says, (<i>right out loud</i>&mdash;men are so stupid!) '<i>What
did you say, dear?</i>' Of course you protest you
didn't say a word&mdash;<i>never thought of such a thing</i>!
and cuddle your head down to your ruffled pillows,
and cry because you don't know what else to do,
and because you are weak and weary, and full of
care for your family, and don't want to see anybody
but 'Charley.'</p>

<p>"Nurse says 'she shall have you sick,' and tells
your husband 'he'd better go down, and let you
go to sleep.' Off he goes, wondering what on
earth ails you, <i>to cry</i>!&mdash;wishing <i>he</i> had <i>nothing to
do</i> but lie still, and be waited upon! After dinner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
he comes in to bid you good-bye before he goes to
his office&mdash;whistles 'Nelly Bly' loud enough to
wake up the baby, (whom he calls '<i>a comical little
concern</i>)!' and puts his dear thoughtless head down
to your pillow, (at a signal from you,) to hear what
you have to say. Well, there's no help for it, you
cry again, and only say '<i>dear</i> Charley,' and he
laughs, and settles his dickey, and says you are 'a
nervous little puss,' gives you a kiss, lights his
cigar at the fire, half strangles the new baby with
the first whiff, and <i>takes your heart off with him
down street</i>!</p>

<p>"And you lie there and eat <i>that</i> gruel! and pick
the <i>fuzz</i> all off the blanket, and make faces at the
nurse, under the sheet, and wish Eve had never
ate that apple (Genesis 3: 16;) or that you were
'<i>Abel</i>' to '<i>Cain</i>' her for doing it!"&mdash;

MRS. ZEBEDEE SMITH'S
PHILOSOPHY.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Dear me! how <i>expensive it is to be poor</i>. Every
time I go out, my best bib and tucker has to go
on. If Zebedee was worth a cool million, I might
wear a coal-hod on my head, if I chose, with perfect
impunity. There was that old nabob's wife
at lecture, the other night, in a dress that might
have been made for Noah's great-grandmother.
<i>She can afford it!</i> Now if it rains knives and
forks, I must sport a ten dollar hat, a forty dollar
dress, and a hundred dollar shawl. If I go to a
concert, I must take the highest priced seat, and
ride there and back, just to let 'Tom, Dick and
Harry' see that I can afford it. Then we must
hire the most expensive pew in the broad-aisle of
a tip-top church, and give orders to the sexton not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
to admit any strangers into it who look snobbish.
Then my little children, Napoleon Bonaparte and
Dona Maria Smith, can't go to a public school,
because, you know, <i>we shouldn't have to pay anything</i>.</p>

<p>"Then if I go shopping, to buy a paper of
needles, I have to get a little chap to bring them
home, because it wouldn't answer for me to be
seen carrying a bundle through the streets. We
have to keep three servants where one might do;
and Zebedee's coats have to be sent to the tailor
when they need a button sewed on, <i>for the look of
the thing</i>.</p>

<p>"Then if I go to the sea-shore, in summer, I
can't take my comfort, as rich people do, in gingham
dresses, loose shoes, and cambric sun-bonnets.
My senses! no! I have to be screwed up by ten
o'clock in a Swiss muslin dress, a French cap, and
the contents of an entire jeweller's shop showered
over my person; and my Napoleon Bonaparte and
Dona Maria can't go off the piazza, because the
big rocks and little pebbles cut their toes so badly
through their patent kid slippers.</p>

<p>"Then if Zebedee goes a-fishing, he wouldn't
dare to put on a linen coat for the price of his
reputation. No indeed! Why, he never goes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the barn-yard without drawing on his white kids.
Then he orders the most ruinous wines at dinner,
and fees those white jackets, till his purse is as
empty as an egg-shell. I declare it is <i>abominably</i>
expensive. I don't believe <i>rich people</i> have the
least idea how much it costs <i>poor people</i> to live!"</p>

<p>"Didn't <i>it though</i>! I FAN-cy it <i>does</i>! If there's
anything in the world that is <i>quite entirely</i> interesting,
it's a man who daresn't <i>say</i> 'I love you,'
though <i>his</i> eyes told the story long ago! Of course
you don't <i>know</i> anything about it. Oh, no!
Can't, for the soul of you, tell why he never comes
near you without a tremor, or what possesses him
to say 'yes,' instead of 'no,' or to kiss your little
brother so often, and give him so much sugar-candy!
Have no idea <i>why</i> he looks so '<i>distrait</i>'and embarrassed, when you take another gentleman's
arm or smile at him. Never see that bright
magnetic sparkle in his eye when you call him
<i>Harry</i>, instead of <i>Mr.</i> Fay. Don't see him pick up
a rosebud that you dropped from your girdle, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
hide it in his vest! (<i>don't like it, either!!</i>) You
don't notice what a <i>long job</i> he makes of it, putting
your shawl on. You haven't the slightest suspicion
<i>where</i> the <i>mate</i> of your little kid glove went,
the last time you went to walk; you are <i>not at all
magnetically affected yourself</i>! Oh, no, <i>not a bit of
it</i>! Just as cool as a fur&mdash;<i>refrigerator</i>!</p>

<p>"Don't feel a bit <i>nervous</i> when your mother gets
up and leaves the room! Always have a topic at
your tongue's end to dash off on. Never pick
your ribbons all to pieces because you daresn't
look him in the face. Never <i>refuse</i> to go to ride
with him, when you are just <i>dying</i> to go. Never
blush as red as a pulpit cushion, when your
brother teases you about him, or say 'you don't care
a fig for him.' When <span class="smcap">HIS</span> ring at the door sends
your heart to your mouth, you never snatch up a
book and get so <i>entirely</i> absorbed in it, that he is
obliged to touch your arm, before you can find out
that he's in your presence! <i>You never read his
notes, when you could say them all off with your eyes
shut!</i> You never <i>hide them</i> where anybody can
find them&mdash;without you should be taken with a
fainting fit! You take precious good care to keep
<i>all that</i> from <i>Mr.</i> Fay!</p>

<p>"All right, dear; don't hold out a <i>single straw to
help him ashore</i>! Make him come <i>every step</i> of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
way <i>without a guide-board</i>! but when be <span class="smcap">GETS

<p>"'<i>Faint heart never won fair lady</i>,' hey! <i>I differ!</i>

all the antagonism in our nature! The more you
<i>are sure you'll win, the more you won't</i>! You've to

THE ANGEL CHILD.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Little Mabel had no mother. She was slight,
and sweet, and fragile, like her type, the lily of
the valley. Her little hand, as you took it in
yours, seemed almost to melt in your clasp. She
had large, dark eyes, whose depths, with all your
searching, you might fail to fathom. Her cheek
was very pale, save when some powerful emotion
lent it a passing flush; her fair, open brow might
have defied an angel's scrutiny; her little footfall
was noiseless as a falling snow-flake; and her
voice was sweet and low as the last note of the
bird ere it folds its head under its wing for its
nightly slumber.</p>

<p>"The house in which Mabel lived, was large and
splendid. You would have hesitated to crush with
your foot the bright flowers on the thick, rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
carpet. The rare old pictures on the walls were
marred by no envious cross-lights; light and shade
were artistically disposed. Beautiful statues, which
the sculptor (dream-inspired) had risen from a
feverish couch to finish, lay bathed in the rosy
light that streamed through the silken curtains.
Obsequious servants glided in and out, as if taught
by instinct to divine the unspoken wants of their
mistress.</p>

<p>"I said the little Mabel had no mother; and yet
there was a lady, fair and bright, of whose beautiful
lip, and large dark eyes, and graceful limbs,
little Mabel's were the mimic counterpart. Poets,
artists, and sculptors, had sung, and sketched, and
modelled her charms. Nature had been most
prodigal of adornment&mdash;there was only one little
thing she had forgotten&mdash;the Lady Mabel had no
soul.</p>

<p>"She did not forget to deck little Mabel's limbs
with costliest fabrics of most unique fashioning;
not that every shining ringlet on that graceful
little head was not arranged by Mademoiselle
Jennet, in strict obedience to orders; not that a
large nursery was not fitted up luxuriously at the
top of the house, filled with toys which its little
owner never cared to look at; not that the Lady
Mabel's silken robe did not sweep, once a week,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
with a queenly grace through the apartment, to
see if the mimic wardrobe provided for its little
mistress fitted becomingly, or needed replenishing,
or was kept in order by the smart French maid.
Still, as I said before, <i>the little Mabel had no
mother</i>!</p>

<p>"See her, as she stands there by the nursery
window, crushing her bright ringlets in the palm
of her tiny hand. Her large eyes glow, her cheek
flushes, then pales; now the little breast heaves!
for the gorgeous west is one sea of molten gold.
Each bright tint thrills her with strange rapture.
She almost holds her breath, as they deepen, then,
fade and die away; and now the last bright beam
disappears behind the hills; and the soft, grey
twilight comes creeping on. Amid its deepening
shadows, <i>one bright star</i> springs suddenly to its
place in the heavens! Little Mabel cannot tell
why the warm tears are coursing down her sweet
face, or why her limbs tremble, and her heart
beats so fast, or why she dreads lest the shrill
voice of Mademoiselle Jennet should break the
spell. She longs to soar, like a bird, or a bright
angel. She had a nurse once who told her 'there
was a God.' She wants to know if <i>He</i> holds that
bright star in its place. She wants to know if
Heaven is a long way off, and if <i>she</i> shall ever be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
a bright angel; and she would like to say a
little prayer, her heart is so full, if she only <i>knew
how</i>; but poor, sweet little Mabel&mdash;<i>she has no
mother</i>."</p>

UNCLE BEN'S ATTACK OF SPRING-FEVER.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
"'Tisn't possible you have been insane enough to
go to housekeeping in the country for the summer?
Oh, you ought to hear my experience,' and
Uncle Ben wiped the perspiration from his forehead
at the very thought.</p>

<p>"Yes, I tried it once, with city habits and a
city wife; got rabid with the dog-days, and
nothing could cure me but a nibble of green
grass. There was Susan, you know, who never
was off a brick pavement in her life, and didn't
know the difference between a cheese and a grindstone.</p>

<p>"Well, we ripped up our carpets, and tore down
our curtains, and packed up our crockery, and
nailed down our pictures, and eat dust for a week;
and then we emigrated to Daisy Ville.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>"Could I throw up a window or fasten back a
blind in that house, without sacrificing my suspenders
and waistband button? No, sir! Weren't
the walls full of Red Rovers? Didn't the doors
fly open at every wind gust? Didn't the roof
leak like the mischief? Wasn't the chimney
leased to a pack of swallows? Wasn't the well
a half a mile from the house?</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't laugh. Instead of the comfortable
naps to which I had been accustomed, I
had to sleep with one eye open all night, lest I
shouldn't get into the city in time. I had to be
shaving in the morning before a rooster in the
barn-yard had stirred a feather; swallowed my
coffee and toast by steam, and then, still masticating,
made for the front door. There stood Peter
with my horse and gig (for I detest your cars and
omnibusses.) On the floor of the chaise was a
huge basket to bring home material for the next
day's dinner; on the seat was a dress of my
wife's, to be left 'without fail' at Miss Sewing
Silk's, to have the forty-eleventh hook moved one-sixth
of a degree higher up on the back. Then
there was a package of shawls from Tom Fools &amp;
Co., to be returned; and a pair of shoes to carry
to Lapstone, who was to select another pair for me
to bring out at night; and a demijohn to be filled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
with Sherry, &amp;c. Well, I whipped up Bucephalus,
left my sleeping wife and babies, and started
for town, cogitating over an intricate business snarl
which bid defiance to any straightening process.
I hadn't gone half a mile before an old maid (I
hate old maids) stopped me to know if I was going
into town, and if I was, if I wouldn't take her in,
as the omnibusses made her sick. She said she was
'niece to Squire Dandelion, and had a few chores
to do a-shopping.' So I took her in, or rather she
took <i>me</i> in (but she didn't do it but once&mdash;for I
bought a sulkey next day)! Well, it came night,
and I was hungry as a Hottentot, for I never could
dine as your married widowers <i>pro tem.</i> do, at eating-houses,
where one gravy answers for flesh, fish, and
fowl, and the pudding-sauce is as black as the cook's
complexion. So I went round on an empty stomach,
hunting up <i>my express-man parcels</i>, and wending
my way to the stable with arms and pockets
running over. When I got home, found my wife
in despair; no tacks in the house to nail down carpets,
and not one to be had at the store in the village;
the cook had deserted, because she couldn't
do without 'her <i>city privileges</i>,' (meaning Jonathan
Jones, the 'dry dirt' man;) and the chambermaid,
a buxom country girl, with fire red hair and temper
to match, was spinning round the crockery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
(a la Blitz) because she 'couldn't eat with the
family.'</p>

<p>"Then Charley was taken with the croup in the
night, and in my fright I put my feet into my coat
sleeves, and my arms into my pants, and put on
one of my wife's ruffles instead of a dickey, and
rode three miles in a pelting rain, for some 'goose-grease'
for his throat.</p>

<p>"Then we never found out till cherries, and
strawberries, and peaches were ripe, how many
<i>friends</i> (?) we had. There was a horse hitched at
every rail in the fence, so long as there was anything
left to eat on a tree in the farm; but if my
wife went in town shopping, and called on any of
them, they were 'out, or engaged;'&mdash;or if at home,
had 'just done dinner, and were going to ride.'</p>

<p>"Then there was no school in the neighborhood
for the children, and they were out in the
barn-yard feeding the pigs with lump-sugar, and
chasing the hens off the nest, to see what was the
prospect for eggs, and making little boats of their
shoes and sailing them in the pond, and milking
the cow in the middle of the day, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Then if I dressed in the morning in linen
coat, thin pants, and straw hat, I'd be sure to find
the wind 'dead east' when I got into the city; or
if I put on broadcloth and fixins to match, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
would be hotter than Shadrach's furnace, all day&mdash;while
the dense morning fog would extract the
starch from my dickey and shirt-bosom, till they
looked very like a collapsed flapjack.</p>

<p>"Then our meeting-house was a good two miles
distant, and we had to walk, or stay at home;
because my factotum (Peter) wouldn't stay on the
farm without he could have the horse Sundays to
go to Mill Village to see his affianced Nancy.
Then the old farmers leaned on my stone wall,
and laughed till the tears came into their eyes, to
see 'the city gentleman's' experiments in horticulture,
as they passed by 'to meetin'.'</p>

<p>"Well, sir, before summer was over, my wife
and I looked as jaded as omnibus horses&mdash;she with
chance 'help' and floods of city company, and I
with my arduous duties as <i>express man</i> for my
own family in particular, and the neighbors in
general.</p>

<p>"And now here we are&mdash;'No 9 Kossuth
square.' Can reach anything we want, by putting
our hands out the front windows. If, as the poet
says, '<i>man made the town</i>,' all I've got to say is&mdash;he
understood his business!"</p>

CONNUBIAL ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
On this subject Fanny writes eloquently, as will
be seen by the following sketch. She writes as
if she had learned all about it, in the bitter school
of experience.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"'<span class="smcap">Connubial.</span>&mdash;Mr. Albert Wicks, of Coventry, under date
of December 28th, advertised his wife as having left his bed
and board; and now, under date of March 26th, he appends
to his former notice, the following:</p>

<p>"'Mrs. Wicks, if you ever intend to come back and live with
me any more you must come back now or not at all.</p>

<p>"'I love you as I do my life, and if you will come now, I
will forgive you for all you have done and threatened to do,
which I can prove by three good witnesses; and if not, I
shall attend to your case without delay, and soon, too.'</p>
</div>

<p>"There, now, Mrs. Wicks, what is to be done?
'Three good witnesses,' think of <i>that</i>! What the
mischief have you been about? Whatever it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Mr. Wicks is ready to 'love you like his life.'
Consistent Mr. Wicks!</p>

<p>"Now take a little advice, my dear innocent,
and don't allow yourself to be badgered or frightened
into anything. None but a coward ever
threatens a woman. Put that in your memorandum
book. It's all bluster and braggadocio.
Thread your darning-needle, and tell him you are
ready for him&mdash;ready for anything except his
'loving you like his life;' that you could not
possibly survive that infliction, without having
your 'wick' snuffed entirely out.</p>

<p>"Sew away, just as if there was not a domestic
earthquake brewing under your connubial feet.
If it sends you up in the air, it sends him too&mdash;there's
a pair of you! Put <i>that</i> in his Wick&mdash;ed
ear! Of course he will sputter away, as if he had
swallowed a 'Roman candle,' and you can take a
nap till he gets through, and then offer him your
smelling-bottle to quiet his nerves.</p>

<p>"That's the way to quench him!"</p>

<h2>LXII.<br /><a name="chap_LXII" id="chap_LXII"></a>

WHAT FANNY THINKS ABOUT SEWING
MACHINES.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
There's 'nothing new under the sun;'&mdash;so
I've read, somewhere; either in Ecclesiastes or
Uncle Tom's Cabin; but at any rate, I was forcibly
reminded of the profound wisdom of the remark,
upon seeing a great flourish of trumpets in the
papers about a 'Sewing Machine,' that had been
<i>lately invented</i>.</p>

<p>"Now if <i>I</i> know anything of history, that discovery
dates back as far as the Garden of Eden.
If <i>Mrs. Adam</i> wasn't <i>the first sewing machine, I'll
give up guessing</i>. Didn't she go right to work
making aprons, before she had done receiving her
bridal calls from the beasts and beastesses? Certainly
she did, and I honor her for it, too.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;do you suppose all her pretty little descendants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
who ply their 'busy fingers' in the upper
lofts of tailors, and hatters, and vest-makers, and
'finding' establishments, are going to be superseded
by that dumb old thing? Do you suppose
their young and enterprising patrons prefer the
creaking of a crazy machine to the music of their
young voices? Not by a great deal!</p>

<p>"It's something, I can tell you, for them to see
their pretty faces light up, when they pay off their
wages of a Saturday night (small fee enough! too
often, God knows!) Pity that the <i>shilling heart</i>
so often accompanies the <i>guinea means</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh, launch out, gentlemen! Don't <i>always</i> look
at things with a <i>business</i> eye. Those fragile forms
are young, to toil so unremittingly. God made no
distinction of <i>sex</i> when he said&mdash;'The laborer is
worthy of his hire.' Man's cupidity puts that interpretation
upon it.</p>

<p>"Those young operatives in your employ, pass,
in their daily walks, forms youthful as their own,
'clothed in purple and fine linen,' who '<i>toil not,
neither do they spin</i>.' Oh, teach them not to look
after their 'satin and sheen,' purchased at such
a fearful cost, with a discouraged sigh!</p>

<p>"For one, I can never pass such a 'fallen angel'
with a 'stand aside' feeling. A neglected youth,
an early orphanage, poverty, beauty, coarse fare,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
the weary day of toil lengthened into night,&mdash;a
mere pittance its reward. Youth, health, young
blood, and the practised wile of the ready tempter!
<i>Oh, where's the marvel?</i></p>

<p>"<i>Think of all this</i>, when you poise that hardly
earned dollar, on your business finger. What if
it were your own delicate sister? Let a <span class="smcap">LITTLE</span>
heart creep into that shrewd bargain. 'Twill be
an investment in the Bank of Heaven, that shall
return to you four-fold."</p>

THE TIME TO CHOOSE.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Mrs. Chrissholm says:&mdash;"The best time to
choose a wife is early in the morning. If a
young lady is at all inclined to sulks and slatternness,
it is just before breakfast. As a general
thing, a woman don't get on her temper, till after
10 A. M."</p>

<p class="p2">Very spiritedly Fanny makes answer:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"'<i>Men</i> never look slovenly before breakfast&mdash;no
indeed! Never run round vestless in their
stocking-feet, with dressing-gown inside out; soiled
hankerchief hanging by one corner out of the
pocket; minus dickey; minus neck-tie; pantaloon
straps flying at their heels; suspenders streaming
from their waistband; chin shaved on one side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
lathered on the other; last night's coat and pants
on the floor, just where they hopped out of them;
face snarled up in forty wrinkles, because the
chamber fire won't burn; and because it snows;
and because the office-boy hasn't been for the
keys; and because the newspaper hasn't come;
and because they smoked too many cigars <i>by one
dozen</i>, the night before; and because they lost <i>that</i>
bet, and can't pay the <i>Scot-t</i>; and because there's
an omelet instead of a chicken-leg for breakfast;
and because they are out of sorts and shaving-soap;
and out of cigars and credit; and can't <i>any
how</i> 'get their temper on,' till they get some
money and a mint julap!</p>

<p>"Any time 'before 10 o'clock,' is the time to
'choose' a husband&mdash;<i>perhaps</i>!"</p>

OUR NELLY.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
This is one of Fanny's sweet bits of pathos; so
sweet, so pure, it would furnish an apology for
half a volume of coarse slang:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"'Who is she?' 'Why, that is our Nelly, to
be sure.' Nobody ever passed Nelly without asking,
'Who is she?' One can't forget the glance
of that blue eye, in a hurry; nor the waving of
those golden locks; nor the breezy grace of that
lithe figure; nor those scarlet lips, nor the bright,
glad sparkle of the whole face; and then she is
not a bit proud; although she steps so like a queen
she would shake hands just as quick with a horny
palm as with a kid glove. The world can't spoil
'our Nelly,' for her heart is in the right place.</p>

<p>"'You should have seen her thank an old
farmer, the other day, for clearing the road, that
she might pass. He shaded his eyes with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
hand, when she swept by, as if he had been dazzled
by a sudden flash of sunlight, and muttered to
himself, as he looked after her&mdash;'Won't she
make somebody's heart ache?' Well, she has, but
it is because from among all her lovers she could
marry but one, and, God save us! that her choice
should have fallen upon Walter Lee! If he don't
quench out the love-light in those blue eyes, my
name is not John Morrison. I've seen his eyes
flash when things didn't suit him; I've seen him
nurse his wrath to keep it warm till the smouldering
embers were ready for conflagration. He's as
vindictive as an Indian. I'd as soon mate a dove
with a tiger, as give him 'our Nelly.' There's a
dozen noble fellows, this hour, ready to lay down
their lives for her, and yet out of the whole crowd
she must choose Walter Lee. Oh, I have no
patience to think of it. Well-a-day! mark my
words, he will break her heart before a twelve-month!
He's a pocket edition of Napoleon.'</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>"A year had passed by, and amid the hurry of
business and the din of the great city, I had quite
forgotten Glenburn and its fairy queen. It was a
time to recall her to mind, that lovely June morning&mdash;with
its soft fleecy clouds, its glad sunlight,
its song of birds, and its breath of roses; and so I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
threw the reins on Romeo's neck, that he might
choose his own pace down the sweet-briar path,
to John Morrison's cottage. And there sat John,
in the doorway, smoking his pipe, with Towser
crouched at his feet, in the same old spot, just as
if the sun had never gone down behind the hills
since I parted with him.</p>

<p>"'And 'our Nelly,' said I, taking up the thread
of his year old narrative as though it had never
been broken&mdash;'and 'our Nelly?'</p>

<p>"'Under the sod,' said the old man, with a dark
frown; 'under the sod. He broke her heart, just
as I told you he would. Such a bridal as it was!
I'd as lief have gone to a funeral. And then Walter
carried her off to the city, where she was as
much out of her element as a humming-bird in a
meeting-house; and tried to make a fine lady of
her, with stiff, city airs, and stiff city manners. It
was like trying to fetter the soft west wind, which
comes and goes at its own sweet will; and Nelly&mdash;who
was only another name for <i>Nature</i>&mdash;pined
and drooped like a bird in a darkened cage.</p>

<p>"'One by one her old friends dropped off,
wearied with repeated and rude repulses from her
moody husband, till he was left, as he desired,
master of the field. It was astonishing the ascendancy
he gained over his sweet wife, contemptible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
as he was. She made no objection to his most
absurd requirements; but her step lost its spring,
her eye its sparkle; and one might listen long for
her merry-ringing laugh. Slowly, sadly, to Nelly
came that terrible conviction from which a wife
has no appeal. Ah! there is no law to protect
woman from negative abuse! no mention made in
the statute book (which <i>men frame for themselves</i>)
of the constant dropping of daily discomforts which
wear the loving heart away. No allusion to looks
or words that are like poisoned arrows to the sinking
spirit. No! if she can show no mark of brutal
fingers on her delicate flesh&mdash;he has fulfilled his
legal promise to the letter&mdash;to love, honor, and
cherish her. <i>Out</i> on such a mockery of justice!</p>

<p>"'Well, sir; Nelly fluttered back to Glenburn,
with the broken wing of hope, to die! So wasted!
so lovely! The lips that blessed <i>her</i>, could not
choose but to curse <i>him</i>. 'She leaned on a broken
reed,' said her old gray-haired father, as he closed
her blue eyes forever. 'May God forgive him, for
I never can,' said an old lover, whose heart was
buried in her grave.</p>

<p class="left45">
"'<span class="smcap">Nelly Lee</span>, <i>aged 18</i>.'</p>

<p>"'You'll read it in the village churchyard, sir;
eighteen! Brief years, sir, to drain all of happiness
Life's cup could offer!'"

I CAN'T.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
This is a phrase which is "teetotally" banished
from Fanny's "Fern dictionary." Read the following
exordium, and you'll never think of doubting
her assertion, that she is "a little Bunker-Hill"
herself&mdash;a genuine Napoleon in petticoats.</p>

<p class="p2">
"Apollo! what a face! doleful as a hearse;
folded hands; hollow chest; whining voice; the
very picture of cowardly irresolution. Spring to
your feet, hold up your head, set your teeth together,
draw that fine form of yours up to the
height that God made it; draw an immense long
breath, and look about you. What do you see?
Why, all creation taking care of number one&mdash;pushing
ahead like the car of Juggernaut, over
live victims. There it is; and you can't help it.
Are you going to lie down and be crushed?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>"By all that's holy, no! dash ahead! You've
as good a right to mount the triumphal car as your
neighbor. Snap your fingers at croakers; if you
can't get <i>round</i> a stump, leap over it, high and
dry! Have nerves of steel, a will of iron; never
mind sideaches, or heartaches, or headaches; dig
away without stopping to breathe, or to notice
envy or malice. Set your target in the clouds and
aim at it. If your arrow falls short of the mark,
what of that? Pick it up and go at it again. If
you should <i>never</i> reach it, you'll shoot higher than
as if you only aimed at a bush. Don't whine, if
your friends fall off. At the first stroke of good
luck, by Mammon! they'll swarm around you like
a hive of bees, till you are disgusted with human
nature.</p>

<p>"'<i>I can't!</i>' Oh, pshaw! I throw my glove in
your face, if I <i>am</i> a woman! You are a disgrace
to corduroys. What! a <i>man</i> lack courage! A
<i>man</i> want independence! A <i>man</i> to be discouraged
at obstacles! A man afraid to face anything
on earth save his Maker! Why! <i>I'm a little
'Bunker Hill,' myself!</i> I've the most unmitigated
contempt for you! you little <i>pus</i>illanimous pussy
cat! There's nothing manly about you, except
your whiskers."

MRS. SMITH'S REVERIE, WRITTEN
OUT BY FANNY FERN.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"'All dissimulation is disloyality to love.'</p>
</div>

<p>"'I've <i>thought</i> so before,' said Mrs. Smith; 'but now
I <i>know</i> it, <i>because I read it in the newspapers</i>.
These editors beat the D&mdash;utch for understanding
human nature, (all except female nature;) <i>there</i>
they are decidedly benighted. However, it isn't
for my interest to throw any light on <i>that</i> subject;
it is an interesting study that I shan't interfere
with. But this is a digression. As I was
saying, 'dissimulation is disloyalty to love.'
Didn't Mr. Smith tell me, when he asked me,
on his knees, to make him the happiest of
men, that I was the only daughter of Eve he ever
fancied; and didn't I, before the honey-moon was
over, find in his old bachelor trunk, locks of hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
of every color the sun ever shone upon? And
doesn't it do me good to put my matrimonial
foot on the cricket that I stuffed with them?
Certainly&mdash;I only wish I had their entire scalps!</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;didn't he come home one Sunday, with
a face as long as an orthodox steeple, and give me
'the text and heads of the discourse,' when he
had been off rolling ninepins all the morning?
And didn't I always know, when he kissed me,
or gave me a twenty dollar bill, (which was much

symptom of a desperate flirtation with somebody?
and wasn't I sure, when that buff vest, and blue
coat with bright brass buttons, went on, that there
was immense execution to be done somewhere on
forbidden ground?</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;'Life is short;' so is Mr. Smith. No
help for either, that I know of! I'm too busy,
amusing myself, to attend to his little derelictions.
If there's anything that I ignore it is curiosity. It
is so decidedly a <i>masculine failing</i> that I scorn to
be guilty of it!"</p>

A NIGHT-WATCH WITH A DEAD
INFANT.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
"Moorest thou thy bark so soon, little voyager?
Through those infant eyes, with a prophet's
vision, sawest thou life's great battle-field, swarming
with fierce combatants? Fell upon thy timid
ear the far-off din of its angry strife? Drooped
thy head wearily on the bosom of the Sinless,
<i>fearful of earthly taint</i>? Fluttered thy wings
impatiently 'gainst the bars of thy prison-house,
sweet bird of Paradise?</p>

<p>"God speed thy flight! No unerring sportsman
shall have power to ruffle thy spread pinions,
or maim thy soaring wing. No sheltering nest
had earth for thee, where the chill wind of sorrow
might not blow! No garden of Eden, where the
serpent lay not coiled beneath the flowers! No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
'Tree of Life,' whose branches might have sheltered
thee for aye!</p>

<p>"Warm fall the sunlight on thy grassy pillow,
sweet human blossom! Softly fall the night dews
on the blue-eyed violet above thee! Side by side
with thee are hearts that have long since ceased
hoping or aching. There lies the betrothed
maiden, in her unappropriated loveliness; the
bride, with her head pillowed on golden tresses,
whose rare beauty, even the Great Spoiler seemed
loth to touch; childhood, but yesterday warm and
rosy on its mother's breast; the loving wife and
mother, in life's sweet prime; the gray-haired
pastor, gone to his reward; the youth of crisped
locks and brow unfurrowed by care; the heartbroken
widow, and tearful orphan, all await with
folded hands, closed eyes, and silent lips, alike
with thee, the resurrection morn."</p>

A LITTLE GOOD ADVICE.&mdash;FROM
FANNY FERN.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"'No person should be delicate about asking for what is
properly his due. If he neglects doing so, he is deficient in
that spirit of independence which he should observe in all his
actions. Rights are rights, and, if not granted, should be
demanded.'</p>
</div>

<p>"A <i>little</i> 'Bunker Hill' atmosphere about
that! It suits my republicanism; but I hope
no female sister will be such a novice as to suppose
it refers to any but <i>masculine</i> rights. In
the first place, my dear woman, 'female rights' is
debateable ground; what you may call a 'vexed
question.' In the next place, (just put your ear
down, a <i>little</i> nearer) granted we <i>had</i> 'rights,' the
more we 'demand' 'em, the <i>more we shan't get 'em</i>.
I've been converted to that faith this some time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
No sort of use to waste lungs and leather trotting
to <span class="smcap">Sigh</span>-racuse about it. The instant the subject
is mentioned, the lords of creation are up and
dressed. Guns and bayonets the order of the day;
<i>no surrender</i> on every flag that floats! The only
way left is to pursue the 'Uriah Heep' policy;
look <i>umble</i>, and be almighty cunning. Bait 'em
with submission, and then throw the noose over
the will. Appear not to have any choice, and as
true as gospel you'll get it. Ask <i>their</i> advice, and
they'll be sure to follow <i>yours</i>. Look <i>one</i> way,
and <i>pull another</i>! Make your reins of silk, <i>keep
'em out of sight, and drive where you like</i>!"</p>

THE OTHER ONE.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Somebody rather ambiguously remarks:&mdash;
"Let cynics prattle as they may, our existence
here, without the presence of the other sex, would
be only a dark and cheerless void."</p>

<p class="p2">Fanny inquires, in reply:&mdash;"<i>Which</i> 'other sex?'
Don't be so obscure. Dr. Beecher says, 'that a
writer's ideas should stand out like rabbit's ears, so
that the reader can get hold of them.' If you
alluded to the female sex, I don't subscribe to it.
I wish they were all 'translated.' If there is anything
gives me the sensations of a landsman on his
first sea voyage, it is the sight of a bonnet. Think
of female friendship! Two women joining the
Mutual Admiration Society; emptying their budget
of love affairs; comparing bait to entrap victims,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
sighing over the same rose leaf; sonnetizing the
same moonbeam; patronizing the same milliner,
and <i>exchanging female kisses</i>! (Betty, hand me my
fan!)</p>

<p>"Well, let either have one bonnet or one lover
more than the other&mdash;or, if they are blue stockings,
let either be one round the higher on Fame's
ladder&mdash;bodkins and darning-needles! what a tempest!
Caps and characters in such a case are of
no account at all. Oh, there never should be but
one woman alive at a time. Then the fighting
would be all where it belongs&mdash;in the masculine
camp. What a time there'd be, though! Wouldn't
she be a belle? Bless her little soul; how she
would queen it. It makes me clap my hands to
think of it. <i>The only woman in the world!</i> If it
was me, shouldn't they all leave off smoking, and
wearing those odious plaid continuations? Should
they ever wear an outside coat, with the flaps cut
off, or a Kossuth hat, or a yellow Marseilles vest?
or a mammoth bow on their neck-ties; or a turnover
dickey; or a watch-chain; or a ring on the
little finger; or any other abomination or off-shoot
of dandyism whatsoever? Shouldn't I politely
request them all to touch their hats, instead of
jerking their heads, when they bowed? Wouldn't
I coax them to read me poetry till they had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
bronchitis? Wouldn't they play on the flute, and
sing the soul out of me? And then if they were
sick, wouldn't I pet them, and tell them all sorts of
comicalities, and make time fly like the mischief?
Shouldn't wonder!"</p>

A PEN AND INK SKETCH.&mdash;BY FANNY
FERN.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
"Do you suppose Diogenes Dinkey would know
his own portrait, if I drew it? It won't hurt
me if he does, so long as it is a disputed point
'whether <i>I be I</i>.' Well, his proportions were decidedly
alderman-ic, and his gait strongly resembled
that of the wooden horses one sees jerked
across the stage at the theat&mdash;I mean the museum!
Such a stiff dickey as he wore! What prevented
his ears from being sawed off by it, was beyond
me.</p>

<p>"Diogenes was a saint and an epicure; divided
his affections equally between veal pies and vestry
meetings; in fact the former depended on his proper
observance of the latter, as he was supported by
sixpenny contributions from humbugged brethren
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
who considered him a celestial luminary. Of
course he made his appearance simultaneously with
the sexton, and kept popping up and down, in
service time, like one of those corn-stalk witches,
that country children play with. There was no
'napkin' big enough to hide his 'talent;' he endorsed
everything the minister said; not mentioning
what the deacons got off, and after that he put
the audience to sleep by chasing round some idea
of his own, till he lost it; and then he sat down.
You didn't catch him raising any vexed questions
about 'dipping,' or 'sprinkling,' or 'high church,'
or 'low church,' not he! he had a real millennial
disposition; never raised any theological fences
he couldn't crawl under, or climb over, to pick up
windfall sixpences to swell his salary for the benefit
of his fellow-creatures in general and <i>himself in
particular</i>. He didn't care a torn hymn-book,
whether it was a Baptist, or Episcopalian, or Unitarian
hand he shook, as long as it left a bonus in
his saintly palm.</p>

<p>"Poor Diogenes! he was affected with spasmodic
near-sightedness, that always attacked him when
he saw a Paul Pry in the distance who might hold
him by the button long enough to desire statistics
of the amount of good he had performed. He
liked to be inquisitorial himself; but, like most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
persons of that description, he was not particular
to have the compliment returned. He had a voluminous
robe of dignity he threw on, at times,
when escape was impossible, that was very excrutiating
to anybody who knew what was underneath
it.</p>

<p>"Long life to you, Diogenes! I wouldn't lose
you for a bright sixpence.</p>

<p>"I've attended many a conventicle where you
were the chief attraction; you are a perfect study

FANNY'S "RULES FOR LADIES."</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
"Never walk on the Common; it is 'vulgar;'
dusty streets and a chorus of rattling omnibusses
are more refined. Never go out in damp,
cloudy or rainy weather. India rubbers and umbrellas
are only fit for common people. Should it
storm six weeks on a stretch, better ruin your
health, than appear in anything but paper soles
and silk dresses. When the chill autumn winds
blow, go out in drapery sleeves, that the wind
may have a free pass round your elbows. Don't
disarrange your curls by bowing to an elderly
person; nor by any manner of means recognize a
male or female who is not a walking advertisement
for a tailor or a milliner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p>"Always whisper and laugh at concerts, by
way of compliment to the performers, and to show
your neighbors a sovereign contempt for their
comfort. When Betty is brushing your hair, or
lacing your boots, listen with avidity to all the
gossip she can muster; it will encourage her laudable
desire to take notes of <i>your</i> establishment for
the benefit of her next mistress. Always keep
<i>callers</i> waiting, till they have had time to notice
the outlay of money in your parlors. It isn't a
bad plan to send a <i>child</i> into the room to act as
'special reporter!' Always take physic on <i>Sunday</i>,
and have a novel handy; or, you can write
or read love-letters. Never on any account go
into your kitchen, or know the difference between
the manufacture of an omelet or an apple-pie.
Call into your nursery once a week to see if Tommy's
hair has begun to curl. Keep Betty till
one o'clock at night, sitting up for your return;
and order her to get up at four o'clock in the
morning. Keep as many flirtations on hand as
you conveniently can, without getting into a snarl.</p>

<p>"Be just as gracious in your manner to a practised
<i>roué</i>, (provided he has the entrance into good
society,) as you would to a man deserving a
woman's respect. Dispute with your sempstress
about a ninepence, and buy a thousand dollar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
shawl. Present the bouquet your <i>last</i> admirer
sent you, to the next one who looks into your
'starry eyes!' Dance all night, sleep all day, and
waltz with anybody who is the '<i>ton</i>.'"</p>

THE LITTLE PAUPER.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
This is one of Fanny's most life-like word-paintings.</p>

<p class="p2">
"It is only a little pauper! Never mind her.
You see she knows her place, and keeps close to
the wall, as if she expected an oath or a blow.
The cold winds are making merry with those thin
rags. You see nothing of childhood's rounded
symmetry in those shrunken limbs and pinched
features. Push her one side, <i>she's used to it</i>; she
won't complain; she can't remember that she ever
heard a kind word in her life. She'd think you
were mocking if you tried it.</p>

<p>"She passes into the warm kitchen, savory with
odorous dainties, and is ordered out with a threat
by the portly cook. In the shop windows she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
sees nice fresh loaves of bread and tempting little
cakes. Rosy little children pass her, on their way
to school, well-fed, well-clad and joyous, with a
mother's parting kiss yet warm on their sweet
lips.</p>

<p>"There seems to be happiness enough in the
world, but it never comes to <i>her</i>. Her little basket
is quite empty; and now, faint with hunger,
she leans wearily against that shop window.
There is a lovely lady, who has just passed in.
She is buying cakes and <i>bon-bons</i> for her little girl
as if she had the purse of Fortunatus. How nice
it must be to be warm, and have enough to eat!
Poor Meta! She has tasted nothing since she
was sent forth with a curse in the morning, to beg
or&mdash;steal, and the tears <i>will</i> come; there is happiness
and plenty in the world&mdash;but <i>none for Meta</i>!</p>

<p>"Not so fast, little one! Warm hearts beat
sometimes under silk and velvet. That lady has
caught sight of your little woe-begone face and
shivering form. Oh! what if it were <i>her</i> child?&mdash;and,
obeying a sweet maternal impulse, she passes
out the door, takes those little benumbed fingers
in her daintily gloved hands, and leads the child,
wondering, shy and bewildered, into fairy land.</p>

<p>"A delightful and novel sensation of warmth
creeps over those frozen limbs&mdash;a faint color tinges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
the pale cheeks, and the eyes grow liquid and
lovely, as Meta raises them thankfully to her benefactress.
The lady's little girl looks on with an
innocent joy, and learns, for the first time, how
'blessed are the merciful.'</p>

<p>"And then Meta passes out, with a <i>heavy basket</i>
and a <i>light heart</i>. Surely the street has grown
wider and the sky brighter! This can scarcely be
the same world! Meta's form is erect <i>now</i>! her
step light as a child's should be. The sunshine
of <i>human love</i> has brightened her pathway! Ah,
Meta! earth is not all darkness&mdash;bright angels
yet walk the earth. Sweet-voiced Pity and heaven-eyed
Charity <i>sometimes</i> stoop to bless. God's
image is only marred, not destroyed. He who
feeds the ravens, bends to listen. Look <i>upward</i>,
little Meta!"

WHAT FANNY THINKS ABOUT
FRIENDSHIP.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
"And so you have 'the blues' hey? Well, I
pity you! No I don't either; there's no <i>need</i>
of it. If <i>one</i> friend proves a Judas, never mind!
plenty of <i>warm</i>, <i>generous</i>, <i>nice</i> hearts left for the
winning! If you are poor and have to sell your
<i>free-agency</i> for a sixpence a week to some penurious
relative, or be everlastingly thankful for the gift
of an old garment that won't hang together till
you get it home! just go to work like ten thousand
evil spirits, and make yourself <i>independent</i>!
and see with what a different pair of spectacles
you'll get looked at! Nothing like it, my dear;
you can have everything on earth you want, when
you don't <i>need</i> anything. Don't the Bible say,
'to him that <i>hath</i> shall be given?' no mistake,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
you see! When the wheel turns round with you
on the top, saints and angels! you can do anything
you like, play any sort of a prank, pout or
smile, be grave or gay, saucy or courteous, it will
pass muster! you never need trouble yourself&mdash;can't
do anything <i>wrong</i> if you try! At the most
it will only be an '<i>eccentricity</i>!' But you never
need be such a fool as to expect that anybody will
find out you're a <i>diamond</i> till you get a <i>showy setting</i>!
you'll get knocked and cuffed round, and
roughly handled, with paste and tinsel, and rubbish,
till that auspicious moment arrives. <i>Then!</i>
won't all the <i>sheaves bow down to your sheaf</i>?&mdash;not
<i>one</i> rebellious straggler left in the field! But stay
a little. In your adversity found you one faithful
heart that stood firmly by your side and shared
your tears; when skies were dark, and your pathway
thorny and steep, 'and summer friends fell
off like autumn leaves?' By all that's noble in a
woman's heart, give that one the first place in it
now. Let the world see <i>one</i> heart proof against
the sunshine of prosperity. You can't <i>repay</i> such
a friend&mdash;all the mines of Golconda couldn't do it!
But in a thousand delicate ways, prompted by a
woman's unerring tact, let your heart come forth,
gratefully, generously, lovingly. Pray heaven he
be on the shady side of fortune&mdash;that your heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
and hand may have a wider field for gratitude to
show itself. Extract every thorn from his pathway,
chase away every cloud of sorrow, brighten
his lonely hours, smooth the pillow of sickness,
and press lovingly his hand in death."</p>

TRUTH STRANGER THAN FICTION.&mdash;RESPECTFULLY
DEDICATED TO JEALOUS
HUSBANDS.&mdash;BY FANNY FERN.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
"'Percy, <i>dear</i> Percy, take back those bitter words;
as heaven is my witness, they are undeserved
by me. See, my eye quails not beneath yours;
my cheek blanches not; I stand before you, at this
moment, with every vow I made you at the altar
unbroken, in letter and spirit;' and she drew closer
to him and laid her delicate hand upon his broad
breast. 'Wrong me not, Percy, even in thought.'</p>

<p>"The stern man hesitated. Had he not <i>wilfully</i>
blinded himself, he had read truth and honor in
the depths of the clear blue eyes that looked so
unflinchingly into his own. For a moment, their
expression overcame him; then, dashing aside the
slender fingers that rested upon him, he left her
with a muttered oath.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>"Mary Lee had the misfortune to be very pretty,
and the still greater misfortune to marry a jealous
husband. Possessing a quick and ready wit, and
great conversational powers, a less moderate share
of personal charms would have made her society
eagerly sought for.</p>

<p>"As soon as her eyes were opened to the defect
alluded to in her husband's character, she set herself
studiously to avoid the shoals and quicksands
that lay in the matrimonial sea. One by one, she
quietly dropped the acquaintance of gentlemen,
who, from their attractiveness or preference for her
society, seemed obnoxious to Percy.</p>

<p>"Mary was no coquette. Nature had given her
a <i>heart</i>; and superior as she was to her husband,
she really <i>loved</i> him. To most women, his exacting
unreasonableness would only have stimulated
to a finished display of coquetry; but Mary, gentle
and yielding, made no show of opposition to the
most absurd requirements. But all these sacrifices
had been unavailing to propitiate the fiend of jealousy&mdash;and
there she sat, an hour after her husband
had left her, with her hands pressed tightly together,
pale and tearless, striving, in vain, to recall
any cause of offence.</p>

<p>"Hour after hour passed by, and still he came not.
The heavy tramp of feet had long since ceased beneath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
the window; the <i>pulse</i> of the great city was
<i>still</i>; silence and darkness brooded over its slumbering
thousands. Mary could endure it no longer.
Rising and putting aside the curtain, she
pressed her face close against the window-pane, as
if her straining eye could pierce the gloom of midnight.
She hears a step! it is <i>his</i>!</p>

<p>"Trembling, she sank upon the sofa to await his
coming and nerve herself to bear his bitter harshness.</p>

<p>"Percy came gaily up to her and kissed her
forehead! Mary passed her hand over her eyes
and looked at him again. No! he was not exhilarated
with wine. What could have caused this
sudden revulsion of feeling! Single-hearted and
sincere herself, she never dreamed of treachery.</p>

<p>"'Percy regrets his injustice,' she said to herself.
'Men are rarely magnanimous enough to
own they have been in the wrong;' and, with the
generosity of a noble heart, she resolved never to
remind him, by speech or look, that his words had
been like poisoned arrows to her spirit.</p>

<p>"The following day, Percy proposed their taking
'a short trip into a neighboring town,' and
Mary, glad to convince him how truly she forgave
him, readily complied. It was a lovely day
in spring; and the fresh air, and sweet-scented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
blossoms, might have sent a thrill of pleasure to
sadder hearts than theirs.</p>

<p>"'What a pretty place,' said Mary. 'What a
spacious house! and how tastefully the grounds
are laid out. Do you stop here?' she continued,
as her husband reined the horse into the avenue.</p>

<p>"'A few moments. I have <i>business</i> here,' replied
Percy, slightly averting his face, 'and you
had better alight too, for the horse is restive, and
may trouble you.'</p>

<p>"Mary sprang lightly from the vehicle and
ascended the capacious stone steps. They were
met at the door by a respectable grey-haired porter,
who ushered them into a receiving room.
Very soon, a little sallow-faced man, bearing a
strong resemblance to a withered orange, made
his appearance, and casting a glance upon Mary,
from his little twinkling black eyes, that made
the blood mount to her cheeks, made an apology
for withdrawing her husband for a few minutes,
'on business,' to an adjoining room.</p>

<p>"As they left, a respectable middle-aged woman
entered, and invited Mary to take off her hat.
She declined, saying 'she was to leave with her
husband in a few minutes.'</p>

<p>"The old woman then jingled a small bell, and
another matron entered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>

<p>"'Better not use force,' said she, in a whisper.
'Poor thing! So pretty, too. She don't look as
though she'd wear a 'strait jacket.'</p>

<p>"The truth flashed upon Mary at once! She
was in a <i>Lunatic Hospital</i>! Faint with terror, she
demanded to see her husband,&mdash;assured them she
was perfectly sane; to all of which they smiled
quietly, with an air that said 'we are used to such
things here.'</p>

<p>"By-and-bye, the little wizen-faced doctor came
in, and listening to her eloquent appeal with an
abstracted air, as one would tolerate the prattle of
a petted child, he examined her pulse and motioned
the attendants to 'wait upon her to her
room.' Exhausted with the tumult of feeling she
had passed through, she followed without a show
of resistance; but who shall describe the death-chill
that struck to her heart as she entered it?
There was a bed of snowy whiteness, a table, a
chair, all scrupulously neat and clean, but the
breath of the sweet-scented blossoms came in
through a <i>grated window</i>!</p>

<p>"Some refreshment was brought her, of which
she refused to partake. She could not even weep;
her eyes seemed turned to stone. She could hear
the maniac laughter of her fellow-prisoners&mdash;she
could see some of the most harmless marching in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
gloomy file through the grounds, with their watchful
body-guard.</p>

<p>"Poor Mary! She felt a stifled, choking sensation
in her throat, as if the air she breathed were
poison; and, with her nervous, excitable temperament,
God knows the chance she stood to become
what they really thought her! To all her eager
inquiries she received only evasive answers; or
else the subject was skilfully and summarily dismissed
to make place for one in which she had no
interest.</p>

<p>"Little Dr. Van Brunt daily examined her pulse
and 'hoped she was improving&mdash;,' or, if she wasn't,
it was his <i>interest</i> to issue a bulletin to that effect,
and all 'company' was vetoed as 'exciting and
injurious to the patient.' And so day after day,
night after night, dragged its slow length along,
and Percy, with the meanness of a revengeful spirit,
was 'biding his time,' till the punishment
should be sufficiently salutary to warrant his recalling
her home. But while he was quietly waiting
the accomplishment of his purpose, the friend of
the weary came to her relief.</p>

<p>"'Leave me, please, will you?' said Mary to
the nurse, as she turned her cheek to the pillow
like a tired child. 'I want to be alone.'</p>

<p>"The old woman took her sewing and seated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
herself just outside the door, thinking she might
wish to sleep. In a few moments she peeped cautiously
through the open door. Mrs. Percy still
lay there, in the same position, with her cheek
nestling in the palm of her little hand.</p>

<p>"'She sleeps sweetly,' she muttered to herself
as she resumed her work.</p>

<p>"Yes, dame Ursula, but it is the 'sleep' from
which only the trump of the archangel shall wake
her!</p>

<p>"Mary's secret died with her, and the <i>remorse</i>
that is busy at the heart of Percy, is known only
to his Maker."</p>

dickey, and take a sly peep in the glass (for all
that!) and then he'd begin to grow amiable, and
get off his stilts, and be just as agreeable all the

all because I didn't follow that stupid bit of advice

handed it to Mr. Levins Clough, as a healing
plaster for his disappointed expectations, and gone
home, hugging my old man, and resolving to mend
every rip in his coat, gloves, vest, pants, and
stockings, 'free gratis,' from that repentant hour,
till the millennial day. I'd hand him his cigar-case
and slippers, put away his cane, hang up his
coat and hat, trim his beard and whiskers, give
him the strongest cup of tea, and the brownest
slice of toast, and all 'the dark meat' of the

whiskey punches, and mint juleps. I'd help him
get a 'ten strike' at ninepins. I'd give him a
'night-key,' and be perfectly oblivious what time
in the small hours he tumbled into the front entry.
I'd pet all his stupid relatives, and help his
country friends to 'beat down' the city shop-keepers'
prices. I'd frown at all offers of 'pin
money.' I'd let him sit and 'smoke' in my face
till I was as brown as a herring, and my eyes
looked as if they were bound with pink tape;

WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY.</h2>

<p>
"'When you are angry take three breaths before you speak.'</p>
</div>

<p>"I couldn't do it, said Mrs. Penlimmon. Long
before that time I should be as placid as an
oyster. 'Three breaths!' I could double Cape
Horn in that time. I'm telegraphic wire; if I had
to stop to reflect, I should never be saucy. I can't
hold anger any more than an April sky can retain
showers; the first thing I know, the sun is shining.
You may laugh, but that's better than one of your
foggy dispositions, drizzling drops of discomfort a
month on a stretch; no computing whether you'll
have anything but gray clouds overhead the rest
of your life. No; a good heavy clap of thunder
for me&mdash;a lightning flash; then a bright blue sky
and a clear atmosphere, and I am ready for the
first flower that springs up in my path.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>"'Three breaths!' how absurd! as if people,
when they get excited, ever <i>have</i> any breath, or if
they have are conscious of it. I should like to see
the Solomon who got off that sage maxim. I
should like better still, to give him an opportunity
to test his own theory! It's very refreshing to see
how good people can be, when they have no
temptation to sin; how they can sit down and
make a code of laws for the world in general and
sinners in particular.</p>

<p>"'Three breaths!' I wouldn't give a three-cent
piece for anybody who is that long about anything.
The days of stage coaches have gone by. If you
ever noticed it, nobody passes muster now but
comets, locomotives, and telegraph wires. Our
forefathers and foremothers would have to hold
the hair on their heads if they should wake up in
1855. They'd be as crazy as a cat in a shower
bath, at all our whizzing and rushing. Nice old
snails! it's a question with me whether I should
have crept on at their pace if I had been a cotemporary.
Christopher Columbus would have discovered
the New World much quicker than he
did had I been at his elbow."</p>

<p>"'Oh, <i>do not</i> speak so harshly of her, Aunt Nancy!
If you could see how sorrowfully she looks
upon that beautiful boy&mdash;how she starts at the
sound of a strange voice&mdash;how hopelessly she sits
with her large eyes fixed upon the ground, hour
after hour,&mdash;so young and so beautiful, too!'</p>

<p>"'Yes, yes,' broke in Aunt Nancy; 'I dare say!
they're <i>always</i> beautiful. I tell you there's no
mercy for her in <i>this</i> world, or <i>t'other</i>, as I knows
on,' and the indignant spinster drew up her long

<p>"'Don't 'but' <i>me</i>; I tell you I won't have
anything to do with her&mdash;such a thing as <i>she</i> is!'</p>

<p>"What crushing words to fall upon a broken
heart! for Leila's quick ear had caught them.
Her features grew rigid and pallid, and little Rudolph,
frightened at their expression, climbed
timidly to her lap.</p>

<p>"Leila's heart was full of bitterness&mdash;those cruel
words yet rang in her ears; and, for once, she
pushed him rudely from her,&mdash;then the <i>mother</i>
triumphed; and drawing him with a caressing motion
to her breast, she sobbed&mdash;'<i>God pity us!</i>'</p>

<p>"Those were long, weary hours, she passed in
that solitary chamber, in vacant listlessness, with
her head leaning upon her hand, till poor little
Rudolph fell asleep amid his toys, from very weariness,&mdash;then
she would rouse herself, tie on his little
hat, and wander out into the green fields&mdash;on, on&mdash;as
if trying to be rid of <i>herself</i>! But there was
no healing balm in nature. Just such sunny days,
alas! had dawned on her before, when her sky
was pure and cloudless. She accepted mechanically
the little field-flowers that Rudolph placed
in her hand. Those eyes! that brow! those curling
chestnut locks! No <i>father's</i> hand was there
to bless them!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor Leila! Her own sex pass by on the other
side <i>contemptuously</i>&mdash;and the <i>other</i>? (<i>God save her!</i>)
She shrinks nervously from their bold glance of
admiration, and repels scornfully any attempt at
acquaintance. There is no bright spot in the
future, save the hope that the false promise made
in God's hearing to the unprotected orphan will
yet be redeemed.</p>

<p>"Little Rudolph's cheeks crimson with fever.
Leila says to herself, ''tis better he should die,
than live to blush at his mother's name,' and then
she shudders,&mdash;for where on the desolate earth
will she find so loving a heart as his is now?</p>

<p>"The young physician knows her history. Leila
answers his questions with a cold dignity; but he
is generous and noble-hearted, and would scorn
to remind her by word or glance of her sad secret.
Fresh flowers lay between Rudolph's thin fingers,
and delicacies unattainable by Leila, are daily offerings.
Rudolph will need them no longer! Leila
sheds no tear, as the look that comes but once,
passes over that waxen face! But she trembles,
and shudders, as if the last gleam of hope was
shut out by the closing of that coffin-lid. Even
'Aunt Nancy' condescends to pity her, (at a distance!)</p>

<p>"Oh, shame! that woman's heart should be so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
relentlessly unforgiving to her erring sister! Who
shall say, in the absence of a <i>mother's</i> angel watch,
and with a <i>warmer heart</i> than the one that now sits
in cold judgment upon her, Leila's sin might have
been <i>yours</i>? Oh,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>"Lelia sits alone&mdash;pale and passive. The young
physician approaches her respectfully. Leila looks
at him with amazed wonder, as he would raise her
to the dignity of a '<i>wife</i>.' Tears of happy pride
fall from her eyes, at his generous avowal; and so
she thanks him with a full heart, but says, sadly,
'<i>her heart is with Rudolph's father!</i>' and Leila is
left <i>again</i> to her own sad thoughts. She wanders
listlessly about the house&mdash;she takes up a newspaper,
(scarcely heeding what she reads;) she glances
at the list of 'deaths,'&mdash;it is there!&mdash;<i>his name</i>!
and it signs the death warrant of his <i>last</i> victim!
Leila falls heavily to the floor. <i>Her heart is as still
as his own!</i> Betrayer and betrayed shall meet

A CHAPTER ON CLERGYMEN.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
"Oh, walk in, Mr. Jones, walk in; a minister's
time isn't of much account. He ought to expect
to be always ready to see his parishioners.
What's the use of having a minister, if you can't
use him? Never mind scattering his thoughts to
the four winds, just as he gets them glowingly
concentrated on some sublime subject; that's a
trifle. He's been through college, hasn't he?
Then he ought to know a thing or two; and be
able to take up the thread of his argument where
he laid it down; else where's the almighty difference
between him and a layman? If he can't
make a practical use of his Greek and Latin and
Theology, he had better strip off his black coat,
<i>unshake</i> his 'right hand of fellowship,' and throw
up his commission. Take a seat, Mr. Jones; talk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
to him about your crops; make him plough over
a dozen imaginary fields with you; he ought to be
able to make a quick transit from 'predestination'
to potatoes. Why, just think of the man's salary&mdash;<i>and
you helping to pay it</i>! Nebuchadnezzar!
haven't you hired him, soul and body? He don't
belong to himself at all, except when he's asleep.
Mind and give him a little wholesome advice before
you leave; inquire how many pounds of tea he
uses per week, and ask him how he came to be so
unclerical as to take a ride on horseback the other
day; and how much the hostler charged him for
the animal, and whether he went on a gallop, or a
canter, or an orthodox trot? Let him know,
very decidedly, that ministers are not expected to
have nerves, or head-aches, or side-aches, or heart
aches. If they get weary writing (which they've
no business to,) let them go down cellar and chop
some wood. As to relaxation suggestive of beautiful
thoughts, which a gallop on a fleet horse
through the country might furnish, where the
sweet air fans the aching temples caressingly,
where fields of golden grain wave in the glad
sunlight, where the blended beauty of sky and
sea, and rock and river, and hill and valley,
send a thrill of pleasure through every inlet of the
soul&mdash;pshaw! that's all transcendental nonsense,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
fit only for green boarding-school girls and silly
scribbling women,&mdash;a minister ought to be above
such things, and have a heart as tough as the doctrine
of election. He ought to be a regular theological
sledge-hammer, always sharpened up, and
ready to do execution without any unnecessary
glitter. That's it!</p>

<p>"Fact is, Mr. Jones, (between you and I and the
vestry door,) it is lucky there are some philanthropic
laymen like yourself who are willing to
look after these ministers. It's the more generous
in you because we are all aware it's a thing you
don't take the <i>slightest pleasure</i> in doing(?) You
may not get your reward for it in this world,
but if you don't in the next, I shall make up <i>my</i>
mind, that Lucifer is remiss in his duty."</p>

your beloved with a smile of joy and satisfaction&mdash;take her
by the hand&mdash;imprint an affectionate kiss upon her lips.'</p>

<p>"Isn't that <i>antimonial</i>? Don't you do any such
thing! If you've made a married woman of
her, I'd like to know if that isn't an honor that she
might spend a life-time trying to repay you for;
and come out at the little end of the horn <i>at that</i>?</p>

<p>"Land of love! there's many a woman <i>dies</i> of
'hope deferred.' Put <i>that</i> in her ear. Ask her
what in mercy she thinks would have become of
her, if you hadn't taken pity on her. Make her
sensible of her beatified condition. Just tell her
that any 'little favor' you do for her now, is an

extra touch of philanthropy; that you may possibly
go whole days without noticing her at all&mdash;except
to stow away the food she prepares for
you;&mdash;that, as to thanking her for every button
she sews on, Cæsar! the boot is on the <i>other foot</i>!
and should she lose her beauty or get sickly, of
course she can't expect you'll care as much for her
as when she was bran-new&mdash;the idea is absurd.
She has no business to grow ugly; and as to sickness,
it <i>would</i> be stepping off your pedestal to be
puttering round, inquiring whether your wife's
gruel was furnished at the right time or not; you've
got other things to do, of more importance; such
as betting on elections, peeping into concerts and
theatres, and so forth.</p>

<p>"'He might take <i>me</i>, too.' You nonsensical
little nuisance! In the first place&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;well,

rocking-chair and contemplate your stocking-basket;
and if your spirits droop for change of scene,
for a kind word, or a loving glance&mdash;that's nothing!
You can die any time you get ready; he
will stop mourning for you long before the weed
on his hat gets rusty. Besides, the world is full
of women&mdash;a real crowd of 'em; he knows that

<i>That's all there is of Life.</i> If you've got married,
you've climbed to the top of the hill&mdash;so now you
can do as the rest of the wives do&mdash;stand still and
crow a little while; and then commence your
descent. No new discoveries to be made that <i>I
know of</i>. Cry, if you feel like it&mdash;pocket handkerchiefs
are only ninepence a-piece now."</p>

FANNY'S IDEAS ABOUT MONEY
MATTERS.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

"'The Military Argus has a long and prosy article
headed 'How to make Home Happy.' A friend of ours has
now a work in preparation, which solves the question&mdash;'It is
to give your wife as much money as she asks for.' This
entirely abolishes the necessity of kisses and soft sawder.'</p>

<p class="left65">
<i>True Flag, Aug. 28.</i></p>

<p>"Betty! throw up the windows, loosen my belt,
and bring me my vinaigrette!</p>

<p>"It's no use to faint, or go into hysterics, because
there's nobody here just now that understands my
case! but I'd have you to understand, sir&mdash;&mdash;(fan
me, Betty!) that&mdash;&mdash;o-o-h!&mdash;&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;(Julius
Cæsar, what a Hottentot!) that if you have a wife
<i>as is a wife</i>, neither 'kisses,' 'soft sawder,' or
'money,' can ever repay her for what she is to
you!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen to me! Do you remember when you
were sick? <i>Who</i> tip-toe-d round your room, arranging
the shutters and curtain-folds with an
instinctive knowledge of light, to a ray, that your
tortured head could bear? Who turned your
pillow on the cool side, and parted the thick,
matted locks from your hot temples? Who moved
glasses and spoons and phials without collision or
<i>jingle</i>? Who looked at you with a compassionate
smile, when you persisted you 'wouldn't take your
medicine because it tasted so bad;' and kept a
sober face, when you lay chafing there like a
caged lion, calling for cigars and newspapers, and
mint-juleps, and whiskey punches? Who migrated,
unceasingly and uncomplainingly, from the
big baby before her to the little baby in the cradle,
without sleep, food, or rest? Who tempted your
convalescent appetite with some rare dainty of her
own making, and got fretted at because there was
'not sugar enough in it?' Who was omnipresent
in chamber, kitchen, parlor and nursery, keeping
the domestic wheels in motion that there should
be no jar in the machinery? Who oiled the
creaking door, that set your quivering nerves in a
twitter? Who ordered tan to be strewn before
the house, that your slumbers might be unbroken
by noisy carriage wheels? Who never spoke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
weary feet or shooting pains in the side, or chest,
as she toiled up and down stairs to satisfy imaginary
wants, that 'nobody but wife' could attend
to? and who, when you got well and moved about
the house just as good as new, choked down the
tears, as you poised the half dollar she asked you
for, on your forefinger, while you inquired 'how
she spent the last one?'</p>

<p>"'<i>Give her what money she</i> <span class="smcap">ASKS</span> for!' Julius
Cæsar! (Betty! come here and carry away my
miserable remains!) Nobody but a <i>polar bear</i> or a
<i>Hottentot</i> would <span class="smcap">WAIT</span> to have a wife '<i>ask</i>' for
'money!'"</p>

A LETTER TO A SELF-EXILED FRIEND
IN THE COUNTRY.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
"Dear Norah:&mdash;'Tell you the news!' Ah,
I <i>knew you'd come to it</i>! I was <i>sure</i> you'd tire
of your <i>oyster life</i>, up there in the mountains.
Pleasant, isn't it&mdash;after dandelions and buttercups
have ceased to be a novelty&mdash;after you know who
lives in the little brown house opposite, and who
in the hut at the end of the lane? After you have
read through that 'Alpha and Omega' of a country
library&mdash;<i>the Almanac</i>! After you've watched
your landlady wash dishes, and feed pigs, and
make butter, till you are qualified to take a diploma
in those branches yourself! After you've
seen the old rooster fight his hen-harem till they
are subjugated to his lordly mind! After you've
listened to the drowsy hum of insect life, till you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
are <i>half a vegetable</i> yourself! After you have seen
the old ricketty front door fastened up, when the
hens go to roost, and every soul in the house in
the 'land of Nod,' and you sitting at your window,
<i>expiring</i> for a new sensation, though it come
in the shape of a lightning stroke, or a tornado!
listening compulsorily to the doleful doxology of
the cricket, and the <i>base</i> voluntary of the bullfrog,
and lamenting that brick and mortar are <i>unfashionable</i>
in dog-days! True, 'tis a pity&mdash;pity 'tis true&mdash;that
the <i>mind rusts</i>, while the <i>body flourishes</i>, in
the country.</p>

<p>"Not less to be avoided, is that mockery of comfort,
a gay watering-place; where neither mind
nor body can remain <i>en dishabille</i> for one blessed
hour. Where slander, and gossip, and humbug,
reign triumphant; where caps and characters are
pulled to pieces by the feminines, and the chart of
<i>conquest</i> is marked out (without a shoal or quicksand,)
by the <i>gentlemen</i>. Where half a year's salary
is spent in a week by the ambitious dandy,
(in embryo,) who gets laughed at for his pains and
pretensions, and returns with damaged pockets and
wardrobe to his attic room, to be dunned remorselessly
by tailor and laundress for many a pitiless
day. Where the simpering demoiselle who has
cried 'give, give,' to papa's pocket-book, till it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
as dry as 'Gideon's fleece,' catches in the net of
her one hundred dollar shawl and ruinous silk,
some brainless fop, who finds, too late, that '<i>papa's
stocks</i>' are&mdash;<i>nowhere</i>!</p>

<p>"No! no! Commend <i>me</i> to <i>home</i>, with all its
little familiar comforts. Small they may be, but
indispensable. Your nice little rocking-chair, where
you have had so many pleasant reveries&mdash;<i>that</i>
'porte feuille,' and the memory of the friend who
gave it you, and the thousand little mementos that
meet your eye, all suggestive of <i>happiness</i>.</p>

<p>"Commend me to a <i>city</i> home! where my mind
can be kept fresh and bright with interchange of
thought with gifted minds, and my heart warm
with loving words and beaming smiles; where I
can put my hand upon newspapers and new publications,
before they are spoiled for my reading,
by criticisms, and reviews, and <i>parrot repetitions</i>!</p>

<p>"And as for 'trees and fresh air!' a drive with
a friend through the many beautiful outlets from
our busy city; or a <i>walk</i> on our lovely Common,
of a balmy evening, where the fragrance of new-mown
hay comes wafted from the hills across the
river, and the stars are mirrored in the clear depths
of the mimic pond, and the soft wind plays refreshingly
over your heated temples&mdash;then&mdash;a <i>soft, lulling</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
serenade 'in the small hours,' and '<i>rosy dreams
till daylight</i>!'</p>

<p>"'Tell you the news,' hey? Well, the <i>great
Daniel's</i> thoughts, at present, are upon <i>fish-line
and hook</i>&mdash;particularly the last <i>English hook</i>! The
'Maine liquor law' is the <i>main</i> question, and who'll
'pay the <i>Scot-t</i>,' is another! Bread and balloons
have 'riz;' <i>gloves is</i> 'tight;' flowers 'looking up;'
<i>dickies is</i> 'depressed;' '<i>stocks</i>' is '<i>scarce</i>;' <i>belles</i>,
none '<i>in the market</i>:' beaux&mdash;'improving;' guardians
'<i>quiet</i>;' and I am,</p>

<p class="left45">
"Yours, <i>till you get married</i>!</p>

<p class="left65">"<span class="smcap">Fanny Fern.</span>"</p>

<p class="center p4">
THE END.</p>
